There are around 321 shlokas in #Lalita Sahasranama. The preface have 51 shlokas. The main crux constituting the stotra is 183 shlokas. It has 1 dhyana shloka and the phala sruti (explanation on what one can achieve by chanting the stotram) has 86 shlokas.

Amma often says “Whoever chants #LalitaSahasranama daily with faith and devotion, Devi takes care of all his/her material needs. At the same there will also be spiritual progress.”

The Lalita Sahasranama is believed to be composed by the 8 divine Vagdevatas (or Rishis) who are the deities of speech with the following names. 1.Vasini Vagdevi ; 2.Kameswari Vagdevi; 3.Modini Vagdevi; 4.Kamala Vagdevi; 5.Aruna Vagdevi; 6.Jayini Vagdevi; 7.Sarveswari Vagdevi and 8.Koushini Vagdevi. They are believed to be the rishis of this stotram/mantras as there are rishis for every mantras. "Rishis are Mantra-drashtas or "the seers of thought"

The Lalita Sahasranama appears in the uttara khanda( the last part) of the Brahmanda Purana in the form of conversation (Samvada) between the lord Hayagreeva & sage Agastya as the lord initiates the sage with the auspicious wisdom.

Once Lalita #Devi addressed Vasini and the other vagdevathas “I command you – who know the secrets of Srichakra, and of Sri Vidya and other Mantras to compose a hymn of a thousand names that reveal my greatness. Lead the way to let my devotess obtain My grace by chanting it!”. Accordingly Vasini and the other 7 dieties of speech composed the Lalita Sahasranama consisting of the most secret mantras.

There are 51 alphabets in the Sanskrit language. The vag devis used the best words and letters to describe the mother and avoided the most difficult ones to ease the pronunciation thus selecting only 32 letters from the Sanskrit alphabet.

Lalita Sahasranama is said to be a combination of Bhakti, Vedanta and the Yoga Sadhana. Vagdevis are very close to the Mother and no-one else could have described mother in such an authentic and spotless way. They are the deities of speech.Who else can write it better than them!

Subsequently one day Devi sitting on her throne, gave the opportunity of her Darshan to all those who were present in the court, including countless Brahma’s, Countless Vishnu’s, Rudra’s and Sakthi’s such as Mantrini, Dandini and the other inhabitants of heaven. She gave them all the opportunity to worship her. As every one took their seats after the worship, Lalita Devi allowed Vasini and the other deities to chant the Sahasranama by visual signaling. They stood up with their palms joined in devotion and chanted “Lalita Sahasranama” in her praise.

This divine stotra was heard by Lord Hayagreeva from the vagdevis and gave it to sage Agastya. Sage Agastya along with his wife Lopamudra spread gave it to this mortal world. In Tamil Nadu there is a place known as Thirumeichur (earlier known as Sri Puram). It is believed that it is here where the Lalita Sahasranama was chanted for. the first time in this world.

There is a popular story. Once Adi Sankara wanted to write a commentary on Lalita Sahasranama and asked his disciples to bring the palm leaves containing the mantras. The disciples brought a manuscript and gave it to Sri Sankara. When he opened, he found it to be Vishnu Sahasranama not Lalita Sahasranama. Sri Sankara said "Please bring Lalita Sahasranama" . Again a manuscript was given and to the surprise when Sri Sankara opened that too was of Vishnu Sahasranama. This happened repeatedly for many times. Sri Sankara became a bit furious and asked his disciple "Why are you bringing Vishnu Sahasranama when I ask for Lalita Sahasranama?" the disciple replied, "Master, whenever I go to take Lalita Sahasranama, a little girl stands next to the manuscript library and gives me this. I couldn't refuse!". Sri Sankara understood what this implied using his divine vision and created a commentary on Vishnu Sahasranama. Later Sri Sankara composed a beautiful hymn on Mother named Saundarya lahari. Lalitāsahasranāmabhāsya is a commentary (bhāsya) on Lalita Sahasranama by Bhaskararaya. This work was completed in 1728

CE. The translations of this work became popular in all languages in India.

An infant is more affectionate towards its Mother than the father.
pitra nirbhalsitho balah
matreya ashwasithokhila
The father always tries to bring us to disciplined way of life whereas the mother always tries to console us. Even if we do anything wrong, mother forgives and console us.

We praise Devi like this
Bhumau Skalitha Paadaanaam
Bhumireva Avalambanam
Thvayi Jaatha Aparaadhanaam
Thwameva Sharanam Shive
If we slip, we fall on to Mother Earth. In the same way, when we do a mistake the divine Mother forgives and with Her unconditional Love tries to correct us. This is why it is said a baby is attracted more towards its mother. To be continued...

We often argue whether God is having a form or is She formless? Amma often says " Don't think whether God is with or without attributes. Both are in fact the same. Some part of the ocean freezes to become ice bergs. That doesn't make it different from the ocean. It is still a part of the vast ocean. The waters from the ocean vaporises forms clouds and come back as rains. In the same way God can attain any form to Grace us. By attaining any form the formless principle is not being affected". The divine being manifests in front of us as avatars just to Grace and bless us.

In India there are many popular Sahasranamas out of which those of Vishnu, Shiva, Ganapati & Lalita are considered the most famous. Ganga, Kalika, Gayatri, Saraswati, Sita, Shyamala, Rajeshwari, Bhavani, Bala, Parvati, Meenakshi, Radhika, Durga, Lakshmi, are a few among the Sahasranamas of divine mother. Among these, Lalita Sahasranama is the most famous.

The word Lalita means simple. "Laliteti Sundaram" is another definition meaning Lalita means beautiful. "Lalanat Lalita" means the one who is always with us in whatever actions we do. A child plays and walks with the mother without any fear or hesitation, in the same way, this mantra depicts the accessibility of Laita #Devi, who is ever approachable for whatever needs and ready to walk alongside with us in any circumstances.

Eventhough we adore the supreme being as Nirguna (who is beyond all three gunas of nature, namely, Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas), Nishkala(who is without parts), we also praise Her as Nama Narayana pita (who is pleased by the repetition of Her names) . Even if She doesn't have any names and forms, She takes a form and come running towards the cry of Her beloved Children. Hence the first mantra of Lalita Sahasranama is Sri Mata. There are so many names in LS that denotes the motherly nature of Devi, namely Amba, Ayi, Ambika, Dhaatri, Jagad Dhatri, Prasu, Viyadadi Jagad Prasu, Veera Mata, Janani, Jagad Janani etc.

The effort a Mother takes to give birth to a child is enormous. It is because for this reason great souls. like Sri Sankara, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Sri Ramana Maharshi etc were eager to serve their biological mothers. An ordinary mother takes care of our well being in this birth but the Divine Mother is always with us during all our births and tries to uplift us. Not only that this creation and the Mother are not different. We say it as Karya-Kaarana Bandham (Relationship between the effect and the cause). Like gold is needed to create ornaments, Gold is the cause and ornaments are the effect. Mud is the cause and pot is the effect. In this universe the Divine Mother is the cause and effect. Anything that is sentient or insentient is the Divine Mother. She sees everything as Her own and it is because of this we call her Jagad Janani, Jagan Mata etc.
02:34
We add the syllable Sri infront of #LalitaSahasranama and also infront of Mata. This is the peculiarity of the Indian tradition. When we talk about Sannyasins, we usually address them as "Anantha Sri Vibhooshitha", those with infinite auspiciousness. When a mother gives birth to a child, She doesn't know what kind of child she is giving birth to. But by addressing the Divine Mother Sri Mata, we depict the Divine power behind the creation, the energy that had complete knowledge on this creation. In Soundarya Lahari, it is said that without the blessings of Devi, even the trinity (Brahma, Vishnu & Maheshwara) cannot perform their duties.
sivah saktya yukto yadi bhavati saktah prabhavitum
na ced evam devo nakhalu kusalah spanditum api
Without Her blessings, even the Parameshwara cannot pulsate!
Hence this creation is done with the complete knowledge unlike an ordinary mother giving birth. Devi does the Creation (Srishti), Sustenance(Sthithi) and Dissolution(Samhara) through the trinity.

Without Her blessings, even the Parameshwara cannot pulsate! Hence this creation is done with the complete knowledge unlike an ordinary mother giving birth. Devi does the Creation (Srishti), Sustenance(Sthithi) and Dissolution(Samhara) through the trinity. Every object in ti s universe is the creation of the Divine Mother. From the smallest of the organisms to the Brahma, hence we praise in the LS as Om ābrahma kīṭa jananyai namaḥ, who is the mother of everything from Brahma to the lowliest insect. As said earlier, the syllable Sri is added to depict anything that is connected to Devi.

The abode of Divine Mother is called Sri Puram, the path of Sadhana followed is known as Sri Vidya, Sri also depicts the Purusharthas (Dharma, Artha, Kama & Moksha). Out of all these Moksha is the most suspicious and ultimate aim and Devi bestows Moksha, hence she is addressed with the syllable Sri. It is because of this great souls like Sri Sankara, Sri Ramana Maharshi, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and others considered the feminine aspect of the Divine as their own Mother.

Usually people go to their Mothers to unburden their sorrow. It is said like this in the Devi Aparadha Kshamapana Stotram composed by Sri Sankara,

āpatsumagnassmaraṇaṁ tvadīyaṁ | karōmi durgē karuṇārṇavē śivē | naitacchaṭhatvaṁ mama bhāvayēthāḥ | kṣudhātr̥ṣārtā jananīṁ smaranti ||

O Mother I have sunk in misfortunes and therefore remembering You now which I never did before,O Mother, You Who are an Ocean of Compassion, Therefore do not think of me as false and my invocation as pretence, Because When children are afflicted with Hunger and Thirst, they naturally remember their Mother only,

matsamaḥ pātakī nāsti pāpaghnī tvatsamā na hi | ēvaṁ jñātvā mahādēvī yathā yōgyaṁ tathā kuru ||

O Mother, There is no one as fallen like me, and there is no one as Uplifting by removing Sins like You, Considering thus, O Mahadevi, please do whatever is proper to save me. To praise Devi, one do not need to have profound knowledge or practices in mantra or tantra. Nor one need to give huge donations to the temples or perform Japa, dhyana and study scriptures. What she needs is the innocent pure Love. That is what we need to offer to the Mother. She is the root cause of this universe. Like the smallest invisible seed becomes a huge banyan tree and manifests as the trunk, the branches, the leaves and the fruits. If you look into each part, each one is different from the other. The branches are different from the fruits, the fruits are different from the leaves and so on. But the root cause for all these was that minute seed. In a similar way the root cause and foundation for this universe is Divine Mother. When
00:29
we make ornaments from the gold, the bangles are different from the ear stud which intern is different from the necklace but the gold in all the ornaments remain the same. In a similar way it is Devi who is the power of consciousness that pervades the entire creation. She is the cause for this world, Jagad Karini. Hence it is with Her one should unburden your sorrows and share your joy. In happiness or sorrow, we should remember Her.

Aapadi Kim Karneeyam? Smaraneeyam Charanayugalam Ambaayaah!
What to do when in trouble?
Think of the Lotus Feet of the Divine Mother!

All the devatas are Her control. Hence we should always remember Her feet

Sri #Lalita Sahasranama praises #Devi as Vyapini & Vividhakara. This means Devi is Omnipresent and all the forms that we perceive are of Her. In another place, Devi is praised as sahasra śīrṣa vadanā [who has a thousand heads and faces.], sahasrākṣi [who has a thousand eyes.] and sahasra pada [who has a thousand feet.] In Samskritam, Sahasranama also means infinite. Devi is Omnipresent, the energy that pervading everywhere. There was a famous devotee of the Mother named Abhirami Bhattar who lives in a place known as Thirukkadavoor in Tamil Nadu. One he was asked the question “Where is Devi?”. He uses to meditate upon Devi all the time and he couldn’t answer immediately. Some people say Devi is the consort of Lord Shiva always by His side yet some others say Devi is present inside the temple, many others say Devi is present in the various chakras and others say Devi resides in our heart and some people say Devi is in the milky ocean. So, Abhirami Bhattar couldn’t reply immediately. He said, “I don’t know exactly but I feel as if Devi resides in my heart”. This is like the story of a great healer who was once walking through a narrow street. A cow was lying across the path. He didn’t feel like crossing-over the cow, hence he took a stick and tried to scare away the cow. Since he was a healer and knew all the vital points, wherever he tried to beat the cow he saw a vital point that would result in the death of the cow. Hence he was standing there not knowing what to do. An ordinary man approached from the other side. Seeing him the healer asked to drive away the cow. He simply took a stick and beat the cow and it ran away. Since the ordinary man didn’t know about any vital points he could drive away the cow but the healer couldn’t. In the same way, when Abhirami Bhattar was asked where is Devi, he couldn’t answer immediately as he was experiencing Devi everywhere. He praised Devi in his famous Abhirami Anthadi like this

Uraiginra nin thirukkoyil-nin kelvar oru pakkamo,
araiginra naan maraiyin adiyo mudiyo, amudham
niraiginra ven thingalo, kanjamo; endhan nenjagamo,
maraiginra vaaridhiyo?- pooranaasala mangalaiye!

Abhirami! You are ever omnipresent, perfect, and auspicious. Is your abode the left- half of my father Shiva?, or is it the final truth of the Vedas or is your abode the white-moon full of Ambrosia. Is your abode the heart of this simpleton like me? or is it the sacred-milk sea? Would you condescend to tell me what your favorite abode is?

In #LalitaSahasranama, Devi is also praised as
Om nija sallāpa mādhurya vinirbhartsita kacchapyai namaḥ
[who excels even the veena of Sarasvati in the sweetness of Her speech.]
In Soundarya lahari, Sri Sankara describes this as a story. The shloka goes like this

vipañchyā gāyantī vividha-mapadānaṃ paśupate-
stvayārabdhe vaktuṃ chalitaśirasā sādhuvachane |
tadīyai-rmādhuryai-rapalapita-tantrīkalaravāṃ
nijāṃ vīṇāṃ vāṇīṃ nichulayati cholena nibhṛtam ‖
(Saundarya Lahari 66)

Each of the gods and goddesses has a name for their Veena. Narada’s veena is known as tumburu, Mother Saraswati’s veena is known as Kacchapi. One day in the court of the Divine Mother, goddess Saraswati was singing a song on stories of Lord Shiva (Pashupati) which Mother likes the most. It was sung by the goddess Saraswati who is the source of all music and knowledge, so no need to say how beautiful it would have been! Mother was enjoying this and was about to say “Sadhu”, meaning “Good” to appreciate the music. When mother started to utter the word Sa, the entire court’s attention moved to the Mother and goddess Saraswati’s music lost its importance in front of the sweet voice of the Mother. Seeing this, goddess Saraswati understood that there is no more need for my music and covered the veena with the cloth so that the strings throwing sweetest music are not put to shame by Mother’s voice full of sweetness. The above shloka in Soundarya Lahari is repeatedly chanted by music aspirants as part of their sadhana.
06:17
Devi stands as the perfect example of the art of communication. Purvavibhashi Sumukah. We shouldn’t wait for others to open a dialogue. We should open the conversation. We should speak the truth and whatever is pleasant to hear. Devi’s voice is as sweet as a veena. One should talk in a sweet and soft voice.

Madhu-kshira-drakhsa-madhurima-dhurinah phanitayah

Devi’s words are the sweetest rivaling the honey, milk, and grapes. The normal mutterings of Devi alone are enough to shame the veena of Goddess Saraswati.

Devi has a name Bhakta-Namra in Lalita Sahasranama. The dhyana sloka says “bhaktanamrām bhavānīm”. It has a meaning that one who prostrates Her devotees. People come to Mother and are very happy to see Her, the same way Mother is also very happy to see Her children. Everyone prostrates before Mother and Mother prostrates before everyone. Rameshwaram in Tamil Nadu derives its name from the meaning ramayah ishvarah; the lord who stands for the cause of Rama or ramasyah ishvarah; In the same way Devi can be bhaktena namra, the one who is worshipped by the devotees or bhaktaya namra, the one who worships/bow down infront of Her devotees. We can see various shades of Bhakti in different parts of Lalita Sahasranama.

Om sumeru madhya śṛṅgasthāyai namaḥ
[who sits on the middle peak of Mount Sumeru.]
Om śrīman nagara nāyikāyai namaḥ
[who is the Mistress of the most auspicious (or prosperous) city.]
Om cintāmaṇi gṛhāntasthāyai namaḥ
[who resides in a house built of the wish fulfilling gem.]
Om pañca brahmāsana sthitāyai namaḥ
[who sits on a seat made of five Brahmas.]

What these mantras suggests is that, Devi’s palace is built with the most auspicious of the materials. It is built with the Chintamani (the wish fulfilling) gem. The chintamani palace is situated in the middle of a garden full of kalpataru ( a wish-fulling celestial tree) . Legends says that worshipping one single chintamani gem stone is enough to fulfil all the desires, Devi’s palace being built entirely with this chintamani gem is symbolically stating that Mother fulfils all Her children’s wishes. Devi is seated on a special throne held by 5 devatas which symbolizes that Devi is doing Srishti (Creation) as 1. Brahmma, Sthithi (Sustenance) as 2. Vishnu, Samhara (Dissolution) as 3. Rudra, Thirodhanam (Hiding) as 4. Eeswara and Anugruham (Blessings) as 5. Sadasiva. Hence if we think about the palace, Devi’s abode, Her throne, it is very clear that we do not have to go anywhere searching anything. She is capable of granting what we need.

Lalita Sahasranama also praises Devi as Kamakshi and Kamadayini. Once few devotees asked the Kanchi Paramacharya Sri Chandrasekhara Saraswati, “What is the reason that you propagate devotion to the Divine Mother so much?”, the Paramacharya remained silent for a while. The entire crowd around him were eagerly waiting to see what the answer is. He slowly replied “Look at what is happening now. Isn’t this alone enough to unravel the divinity of the Divine Mother? I’m a very old man, I’m not able to talk properly neither do I know how tell jokes nor do I know how to speak in such a way that the listener becomes happy. Most of the time I’m fasting and is observing silence. Inspite of all these, see all these crowds are eagerly waiting to hear what I’m saying. What can you call this if not Kamakshi’s Grace?”

There is sloka in Soundarya Lahari that goes like this
Naram varshiyamsam nayana virasam narmasu jadam,
Thava panga loke pathitha manudhavanthi sathasa
Gala dweni bhandha kuch kalasa visthrutha sichaya
Hatath thrudyath kanchyho vigalidha dhukoola yuva thaya.
(Soundarya Lahari 13)

With disheveled hair and with upper cloths slipping from their busts, with the lock of the golden belt getting open due to the haste, and with saris slipping away from their shoulders, hundreds of young women
run after those who get your sidelong glance, even though they are very old, bad looking and not interested in love sports.
11:46
What is implied is when you go after the devotees of Devi who has Her Grace, not only that devotee but those who follow him/her will also be liberated. They go beyond the body consciousness. They become one with the Mother. Each of their actions becomes the actions of the Mother. Self Realisation is the ultimate goal in one’s life. Eating, drinking, sleep, fear, procreation all these are seen in all living beings but humans have developed the principles of discrimination, dharma & knowledge. Using these uplifting oneself to the supreme state should be the goal of human life. There are four purusharthas goals of human existence) 1. Dharma (Righteousness), 2.Artha (Prosperity), 3.Kama (Pleasure) & 4.Moksha (Liberation). Out of these Moksha is considered. the most valuable and ultimate aim.

Devi is Moksha daayini (One who liberates us). Imagine one became friends with a king. The king is the custodian of infinite wealth. How would it sound when the friend asks the king Rs.500! The king is capable of giving anything. How foolish would it be to return from his palace with a cucumber from the palace kitchen! Devi is ready to offer us the kingdom of moksha. We should ask the right thing, that’s all.

I’m going to narrate a story of an ardent devotee who attained the glance of the Lotus Feet of the Divine Mother. This is a story from the famous Aithihyamala. There was a Namboothiri in North Kerala. He was well settled, but a sudden poverty stuck him and he was ousted from his home by relatives. He didn’t know what to do next. He walked into a nearby forest. He walked for the entire day and was tired. It was late in the evening by then and he searched for a place to rest. He found an ashram of a great rishi and thought he could take refuge there. The compassionate rishi welcomed him, gave him fruits to eat and a place to sleep. The next day morning, the sage asked his whereabouts and he narrated all his life and the problems he faced. He said “ All my relatives now hates me, I’ve been ousted from my own home and no refuge.” The rishi replied, “Do not worry. You can stay here along with me as long as you wish”.

He started to stay with the rishi. The rishi understood with his divine vision that it is because he didn’t do his spiritual practices properly, he has attained this state. He had chanted all the mantras in a wrong way all these time! The master taught him the proper way of chanting and doing the sadhana. He started to do his. practices properly under his master’s guidance. He became a good disciple of the rishi. After many years, he found that his master never sleeps in the night. Also he could hear strange sounds from the master’s room. He became eager to find out what was happening. One night, he went to the master’s room at midnight. To his surprise, he found that a lot of celestial beings are visiting his master every night and are conversing with him! He focussed on what they were talking about and could find that the devatas were inviting his master for a festival in Kailas. The next day morning, the namboothiri went to the rishi and confessed, “I had committed a grave mistake. I peeped into your room yesterday night. I saw the devatas inviting you for a festival in Kailas. Please take also along with you. I too have the desire to attend that festival.” Hearing this, the rishi replied “Only a very few selected and divine beings were allowed to attend such events. I don’t think you are ready yet.” But the disciple was not ready to hear that. He insisted on taking him along. He pleaded to the master to show mercy. The master replied “Ok. But there are some strict guidelines you should follow. You have to always hold to my little finger throughout our visit. Never ever raise your head, always look down. Whatever you may see, do not utter a word”. The disciple agreed.

Thus, with the divine power of the rishi, both of them went to Kailas. There were celebrations at every corner. People were chanting vedas on one side. The sounds of conch and drums could be heard. The entire place were decorated. Celestial dancers and musicians were performing on the other side. Lord Vishnu himself is standing and receiving the guests at the entrance! Everywhere one could see great celebrations. Chantings were going on in one corner, people were debating on scriptures in other, what to say! It was a divine sight to behold. It was noon time, a special lunch was prepared to serve everyone. Our namboothiri also went along with his master to have lunch. Lord Vishnu, Shiva and other god and goddesses themselves were serving the lunch. Devi was serving payasam and reached near our namboothiri. As he was not suppose to lookup, he could only see Mother’s feet.

#LalitaSahasranama describes Mother’s feet as follows

⌘Om gūḍha gulphāyai namaḥ
[whose ankles are hidden.]
⌘Om kūrma pṛṣṭha jayiṣṇu prapadānvitāyai namaḥ
[whose feet have arches that rival the back of a tortoise in smoothness and beauty.]
⌘Om nakha dīdhiti sañchanna namajjana tamoguṇayai namaḥ
[whose toenails give out such a radiance that all the darkness of ignorance is dispelled from those devotees who prostrate at Her feet.]
⌘Om pada dvaya prabhā jāla parākṛta saroruhāyai namaḥ
[whose feet defeat lotus flowers in radiance.]
11:54
Seeing the beautiful feet of Devi, namboothiri couldn’t resist. He looked-up but couldn’t see Mother. The Lord’s servant Nandi understood that there is an uninvited guest among the crowd and kicked him. He fell back to a pond named Peringode (in Palakkad, Kerala) . People who came to take bath in the pond the next day saw him lying in the pond unconscious and took him. Since he got the divine vision of Mother’s feet, he later became very famous. Whatever he prescribed as a medicine for ailments started to work. Everyone started to revere him as a great devotee of the Mother.
Aithihyamala says that just a glance of Mother’s Feet uplifted the stature of this person. Let us remember that Divine Feet of #Devi.

We mediate the forms of the Divine in mainly two different ways. 1. From the Divine Feet upto the Head (Padadi Kesha), 2.From the Head to the Feet (Keshadi Pada). Musculine forms are. usually described from Keshadi Pada and feminine forms in Padadi kesha. But in Lalita Sahasranama, since Devi is the the supreme aspect of all divinity, Devi cannot be attributed to any gender. Hence we could see the description of Devi as Keshadi Pada (from Head to Feet) unlike other feminine forms.

Lalita Sahasranama describes Devi as
Om anavadyāṅgyai namaḥ
whose body is worthy of worship., on whom we cannot find any faults.

Devi is also praised as
Om sarvābharaṇa bhūṣitāyai namaḥ
[who is resplendent with all types of ornaments.]
Normally the person gets benefitted from wearing ornaments. But for Devi, that is not the case. Amma often says ”Do we need to decorate a golden pot?”. Devi doesn’t need any ornaments. By adorning ornaments, the lustre of the ornaments is increased not Devi’s. Even though Mother doesn’t need any ornaments, for the sake of Her children, for others to enjoy and meditate on Her form.

As told earlier, in #LalitaSahasranama , Devi’s form is being described from head to toe starting from
Om campakāśoka punnāga saugandhika lasat kacāyai namaḥ
[whose hair has been adorned with flowers like campaka, etc.]
and ending with
Om śiñjāna maṇi mañjīra maṇḍita śrī padāmbujāyai namaḥ
[whose auspicious lotus feet are adorned with gem studded golden anklets that tinkle sweetly.]

Devi’s hair is adorned with flowers like champaka, asoka, punnaga. She is wearing a beautiful crown named Navamani Mukutam (the crown studded with 9 gems), the crown has a crescent moon. She is wearing a tilak and a bindi on Her forehead. The earrings, various necklaces, finger rings, ornaments worn on the hips, ornaments on the feet and fingers, weapons on Her various arms. 26 types of ornaments were seen various scriptures adorned on Devi. It is not the ornaments that gives lustre to the Mother but the other way round. Thus making all Her children happy, the mother dwells resplendent with all types of ornaments.

#Lalita Sahasranama describes Mother’s smile as
Om manda smita prabhā pūra majjat kāmeśa mānasāyai namaḥ
[who submerges even the mind of Kamesha (Lord Shiva) in the radiance of Her smile.]

This is an everlasting smile. Mother is always smiling. Lord Parameshwara likes to see Mother smiling always. Sri Sankara poetically describes this in a story.

Devi’s garden had many chakora bird (the legendary birds that lived off consuming only the moonlight from a full moon day). Devi use to visit the garden sometimes and play with the chakora birds. On a very rare occasion, #Devi came to the garden. The chakora birds who were contemplating only on the full moon saw the soft smile radiating from Mother’s face. It is said that when compared to Mother’s smile, the resplendent moonlight were nothing for the chakora birds. When go for a feast, if anyone consumes more sweet pudding, will result in a nauseating feeling. This will be neutralized instantly when you consume the sour ginger-tamarind pickle. In a similar way the chakora birds, by seeing Mother’s smile entered a an eternal blissful state. For them, seeing the full moonlight became like having the ginger pickle in between an amazing feast.

स्मितज्योत्स्नाजालं तव वदनचन्द्रस्य पिबतां
चकोराणामासीदतिरसतया चञ्चुजडिमा
अतस्ते शीतांशोरम्रुतलहरी अम्लरुचयः
पिबन्ति स्वच्छन्दं निशि निशि भृशं काञ्जिकधिया
Soundarya Lahari 63

The Chakora birds, feel that their beaks have been numbed, by forever drinking, the sweet nectar like light emanating fromMother’s moon like face, and for a change wanted to taste something sour. Thus, they have started freely drinking, the white rays of the moon in the sky, night after night, thinking that is is sour rice gruel.
12:19
The full moon in a spring season is usually considered as something that evokes happiness in everyone. But Mother’s face is considered more beautiful than that. The living examples for this were the great souls like Sri Rama, Sri Krishna, and divine beings like our Amma. You can always see a smile on their face. In Amma’s dhyana sloka, we chant Manda-smitha-sri-mukhim . The famous Swami Ramdas of Anandasram, Kanhangad use to smile always even if he is alone in his room. This is due to the overflow of the infinite bliss they were experiencing. We could see such great beings smiling and being happy whatever the situations may be.

In Devi’s eyes one could see all the 9 rasas (moods). Soundarya Lahari describes this as follows
शिवे शङ्गारार्द्रा तदितरजने कुत्सनपरा
सरोषा गङ्गायां गिरिशचरिते विस्मयवती ।
हराहिभ्यो भीता सरसिरुह सौभाग्य-जननी
सखीषु स्मेरा ते मयि जननि दृष्टिः सकरुणा
Soundarya Lahari 51

Moved by sentimental love for Shiva, resentful to any other person,
With anger of jealously towards Ganga, as Ganga is Her co-wife.
with transportations of wonder as Devi’s companions narrates various stories of Lord Shiva.

Once a demon named Bhasmasura did along severe penance on Lord Shiva. Pleased on the penance, the Lord appeared in-front of him. Bhasmasura asked for a boon and the Lord said “You can ask anything.”. Bhasmasura then asked that he be granted the power that anyone whose head he touched with his hand should burn up and immediately turn into ashes (bhasma). Lord granted the boon without any thoughts as He was compassionate to His devotees. Bhasmasura then wreaked havoc across the world with his new found power torturing everyone in sight as he was of low moral fibre. So the rishis ran to Vishnu for help. Vishnu, in the form of Mohini, appeared in front of Bhasmasura. Mohini was so exceedingly beautiful that Bhasmasura immediately fell in love with Mohini. Bhasmasura asked her to marry him. She told him that she was very fond of dancing, and would marry him only if he could match her moves identically. Bhasmasura agreed to the match and hence they started dancing. The feat went for days at an end. As Bhasmasura matched the disguised Vishnu's move by move, he began to let his guard down. While still dancing, Mohini, struck a pose where her hand was placed on top of her own head. As Bhasmasura imitated her, he was tricked into touching his own head, and hence Bhasmasura immediately burnt up and turned into ashes, due to the power he had recently gained. When Devi’s companions narrates these stories, Devi’s face would be lit up in wonder. She would ask “Oh really! Did such things happen?”

When #Devi sees the great serpents forming the ornament of Lord Shiva, , She is with full of fearful surprise.  Her face is as fresh as an un-plucked lotus flower and for companions, it gleams with a jestful smile. As a source of lotus-red grace, your regard, oh Mother, for me will remain only of Compassion. Eventhough you exhibit all the moods, Karuna, that if Compassion is alone what I seek. Devi is Naanaa-Bhaava-Prakashini, the one who exhibits several moods. We can see this in Amma’s Darshan, each of the moment the emotions and moods changes according to the devotee infront of Amma. One moment She would be cracking jokes with a Devotee, the next moment we could see Amma shedding tears and sharing the sorrow of another devotee. We usually don’t like Amma getting angry at our faults, what we need is only Her mood of Compassion. This is exactly what Sri Sankara describes in the above sloka.

In the Samudrika Shastra, (the study of face reading, aura reading, and whole body analysis), it is said that the best woman will have three colours in her eyes. Black in the centre, white in the next ring and red colour in the corner. The three colours represents the three gunas. Black-Tamas, White- Sattva and Red-Rajas.

The pure qualities of Sattva or (12) : (1) Kindness (Anarishanyam), (2) Discretion in the use of articles (Samvibhagaruchita), (3) Forgiveness (Titikshna), (4) Truthfulness (Satyam), (5) Righteousness (Dharma), (6) Belief in God (Astikyam), (7) Knowledge (Jnyanam), (8) Wisdom (Buddhi), (9) Intelligence (Medha), (10) Memory (Smriti), (11) Firmness (Dhriti), (12) Non Attachement (Anabhisangshcha).

The wrathful qualities of Rajas are (11) : (1)Excessive Miseries (Dukhabahulata), (2) Roving - Spirit (Atanshilata), (3) Impatient (Adhriti), (4) Pride (Ahankara), (5) Falseness (Anrutikriva), (6) Unkindeness (Akrunyam), (7) Arrogant (Dambho), (8) Vanity (Mano), (9) Pleasure (Harsh), (10) Lust (Kama), (11) Anger (Krodhashcha).
14:20
The ignorant qualities Tamas are (8) : (1) Despondency (Visaditavam), (2) Atheism (Nastikyam), (3) Unrighteousness (Adharmashilata), (4) Unintelligence (Buddhenirrodho), (5) Ignorance (Ajnynam), (6) Dull headedness (Duramegha), (7) Lethargy (Akarmashilata), (8) Sleepiness (Nidralutvam).

All the three colours representing the three gunas can be seen in the eyes of Devi.

We use to go for many pilgrimages. Taking bat in the Triveni Sangama (the conjucture of three great rivers Ganga, Yamuna & Saraswati) is considered auspicious ritual of any pilgrimage in India. But the most auspicious than all these pilgrimage is the glance of Grace from the Great Saints. Their eyes have all the three colours. All these three rivers also are associated with three colours. Ganga is white, Yamuna is black & Saraswati is red. Being blessed by the glance of Mahatmas is considered more auspicious than a dip in the triveni sangama.

All the sacred spots & centres are so because of saints and sages who would have had lived along or visited that place. People read the scriptures and epics like Mahabharata & Ramayana and chat mantras like Gayatri on the banks of these sacred rivers. Great poets are composing their masterpiece poems on the banks of these sacred rivers. The famous Tulsidas Ramayana was composed on the banks of Ganges. In a similar way many great saints have written valuable scriptures from these sacred spots. It is because of al these positive vibrations that the spots becomes so sacred. Sri Sankara describes in Soundarya Lahari that falling under the perimeter of Devi’s glance is considered the most sacred bath and pilgrimage. Kamakshi, Meenakshi, Neelayadakshi, Pankajakshi, Sahasrakshi, etc, are few among the numerous names of Devi describing Her glance. In 108 names of Amma, we praise Amma as
Snigdha-panga-vilokinim-bhaga-vatim
Manda-smitha-sri-mukhim
the mother whose benign glances beam with binding love, the revered one whose divine face beams with a soft graceful smile
Eye have two junctures kaneenakam and apaangam . The juncture near the nose is kaneenakam and the one near the ears is apaangam. This means that it is not needed that Mother should look to us straightly or talk to us but a small glance from the corner of Her eyes is enough. With a mere sankalpa (resolve) of Amma, we are immersed in auspiciousness. There are no much strict rules to be followed to get drenched with Her divine glance. No timings either. One can have as much as one wants. This means we can revere in that rain of compassion eternally.

#Lalita Sahasranama describes Devi as
Om tāmbūla pūrita mukhyai namaḥ
[whose mouth is full from chewing betel]
The Lalita Ashtothara (108 Names) also have a similar mantra as follows
oṃ tāmbūlapūritasmera vadanāyai namaḥ
[Salutations to the goddess who chews  betel and has a smiling face. ]

We never say we eat betel (tāmbūla) unlike other eatables. It is usually said that one ‘wears’ tāmbūla. It is not merely a food item but also is accompanied with areca nut, cardamom, and other aromatic ingredients that is worn (consumed) after food. The process is known as tāmbūla dharanam (wearing instead of eating) because it is not consumed fully. After chewing for sometime, it is spitted out. Not only that it gives red colour to the lips and tongue and is considered as an ornament hence the usage.

There is a story behind this. There was a demon named Tharaka. He got a boon that nobody else but only the son of Lord Shiva & Goddess Parvati could kill him. He became highly egoistic and disturbed all the worlds. Lord Muruga (Kartikeya) was born to Lord Shiva & Mother. There was a huge war fought against Tharaka under the leadership of Lord Muruga. Tharaka was killed at the end of the war. After the war, Lord Muruga and other Gods namely Indra, Upendra, Vishakendra etc were returning after the war. Before leaving Lord Muruga had the blessing of His Father and Mother. Devi had given a special weapon named ‘Vel’ with which Muruga could slay Tharaka. After returning victoriously from the war, Muruga went to the Mother. They all were still in their war suits bathed in blood. They were eager to convey the news of victory to the Mother. Muruga, Indra and other Gods reached Mother’s abode and couldn’t even wait to take rest or remove their war suits. It was the time #Devi had finished the feast and having tāmbūla
Om karpūra vīṭikāmoda samākarṣi digantarāyai namaḥ
14:45
[who is enjoying a camphor laden betel roll, the fragrance of which is attracting people from all directions.]; it is during that time the Gods and Muruga approached the Mother. Lord Shiva was also waiting them in Kailas to hear about the feat of Muruga and the war. Indra and others were thinking that the Lord will also give the sacred prasad. He usually gives it to Chandikeshwara first and then the remaining is given to rest of us. Even though the Lord was waiting for them, they wen to the Mother first. We know that kids want to convey their feats first to Mothers. Father is more strict and might scold us. There are certain rules to be followed to go the Lord. One has to take bath, wear sacred ash, new clothes, wear rudrakshs, chant the 5 syllables and so on. One would not know if the Lord will get angry otherwise. But to go to Mother, no such rules are needed. Her ways are simple.Even if they were wearing blood-drenched clothes, all of the, straight away went to Devi. After hearing all the feats of the war and the slaying of Tharaka, it is said in the scriptures that Mother gave the special tāmbūla named karpūra vīṭikā to all of them as prasad.

Legends say that it is after taking the tāmbūla from the Mother, Kalidasa and others became great poets. The divine power of words can be attained by part taking Devi’s tāmbūla. Thus all of the Gods became happy and left Devi’s abode with the blessings and prasad in the form of karpūra vīṭikā.

The meaning of mantra Om karpūra vīṭikāmoda samākarṣi digantarāyai namaḥ is who is enjoying a camphor laden betel roll, the fragrance of which is attracting people from all directions. This mantra is not used wit its literal meaning alone. The shakta tradition says the devotee of the Mother should always speak softly that his words should spread fragrance around him. His words should not hurt others and should not utter words that are unpleasant for others. Devi is the biggest role model on how to talk. There is a saying Purvavibhashi Susheelah Sukamukah, One’s actions and face are beautiful who opens the conversation without waiting for others to open a dialogue. It is said that Lord Sri Rama was a purvavibhashi and purvanamaskari, He opened the conversation and also he is the first to bow down anyone. Mother is also like that. She opens the dialogue, enquire our wellbeing. She talks in the sweetest way possible and even the scoldings won’t hurt us. It is because of the power of Her words that people are attracted to Devi.

Om kāmeśvara prema ratna maṇi pratipaṇa stanyai namaḥ
Who gives Her breasts to Kameshvara in return for the gem of love He bestows on Her says #LalitaSahasranama about Devi’s bosom. In Dhyana sloka, Devi si described as āpīna vakṣoruhā. Devi resides with a pride that I’m the Mother of all. Apīna vakṣoruhā means the mother who is ready to give milk (of knowledge and auspiciousness) to all Her children. Sri Sankara described about Mother’s bosom and Her breastmilk.
तव स्तन्यं मन्ये धरणिधरकन्ये हृदयतः
पयः पारावारः परिवहति सारस्वतमिव ।
दयावत्या दत्तं द्रविडशिशु-रास्वाद्य तव यत्
कवीनां प्रौढाना मजनि कमनीयः कवयिता
Saundarya Lahari 75

I feel in my mind, That the milk that flows from Your breast, Is really the goddess of learning, Saraswathi, In the form of a tidal wave of nectar.
For , milk given by you ,who is full of mercy, Made the child of Dravida, The king among those great poets, Whose works stole one’s mind.
It is not clear who is this child of Dravida. This is related to many great saints. Bu the most popular one is associated with the divine saint named Thiru Jnana Sambandhar. When Sambandhar was 3-4 years old, one day went to take bath along with his father (Shivapadahridayar) in the temple pond. Since he was too young to take a dip in the waters, the father made him sit on the banks and wen to take a dip. The child became very hungry and started to cry out for milk. Shiva & Parvathi couldn’t bear even the smallest sorrow of Sambandhar, They appeared immediately infront of the child and Devi gave her breastmilk to Sambandhar. When the father returned after the bath, he could see milk flowing from the child’s mouth. He asked “Who gave you milk?” , the child gave a reply with a poem!
தோடுடைய செவியன் விடையேறியோர் தூவெண்மதி சூடிக்       
காடுடையசுட லைப்பொடிபூசிஎன் உள்ளங்கவர் கள்வன்        
ஏடுடையமல ரான்முனைநாட்பணிந் தேத்தஅருள் செய்த         
பீடுடையபிர மாபுரம்மேவிய பெம்மானிவ னன்றே.   
The God who wears a ring in his ears, who comes on the holy Bull
who wears the flawless white Moon on his head
who smears the ash from the cremation ground
the thief(God) who stole my heart
who blessed Brahma(the one on the Lotus) when Brahma prayed earlier
He is none other than the Perumaan (the Lord ) himself of Piramapuram.
14:24
The father was very happy to hear this transformation of his son. He took Sambandhar to all the famous shrines of Lord Shiva in Tamil Nadu and everywhere Sambandhar composed Thevaram (hymns praising the Lord). He became the most revered saint poet from South. There were many similar stories in the life of many great saints. There was a saint named Ramalinga Swami (Vallalar) in Vadathur . He was so compassionate to all the beings that he couldn’t even bear the sight of a small plant wilting. He wrote வாடிய பயிரை கண்டபோதெல்லாம், வாடினேன். I would shed tears on seeing the crops which are withering for want of water. It is said that he has composed more than 6000 hymns on Lord Shiva. In his life also we could see that as a child when he was hungry Devi came in disguise and gave milk. What all these incidents denotes is that all who had the great blessings to get Her Grace have become great poets. These incidents are to expound the greatness of Mother’s Love. This is why we call Devi as āpīna vakṣoruhā, the one who takes pride on being the Mother of All. The large bosom of Devi also symbolically depicts that expansive Motherly nature. She will not move an inch from that nature at all. Let us all remember that Divine Mother.

Om tāṭaṅka yugalī bhūta tapanoḍupa maṇḍalāyai namaḥ
[who wears the sun and the moon as a pair of large earrings.] praises Lalita Sahasranama about the earrings of Devi. The Indian time scales are based on the solar and lunar calendars. We have nazhika (the time taken by earth to rotate by 6 degrees.), day, night, vaaram (a week), paksham ( the period either side of the Full Moon Day), uttarayana, dakshinaya, varsha (year), manwantara and so on. By saying that the sun and moon are the earrings of Devi, we mean that Devi is beyond the time, who is presiding the time. Devi is omnipresent. Her hairlocks is compared to Space. The sun and moon is a mere ornament on Her ears.

The importance of Devi’s earring is described in Saundarya Lahari. The story of churning of the milky ocean (Palazhi) by the devas and asuras is well known to all of us. So many things emerged from the ocean and the most deadly Halahala poison also emerged from the churning about to destroy the creation, when Lord Shiva drank it to save the world. Mother held her hands at the Lord’s neck and Lord Shiva became NilaKanda (the blue throated one). When the dissolution of the world happens, everything cease to exist except Shiva & Parvati. #LalitaSahasranama describes Devi as
Om maheśvara mahākalpa mahātāṇḍava sākṣiṇyai namaḥ
[who is the witness of the great Tandava dance of Maheshvara (Shiva) at the end of the great cycle of creation.]
Om mahā pralaya sākṣiṇyai namaḥ
[who is witness to the Great Dissolution]

सुधामप्यास्वाद्य प्रति-भय-जरमृत्यु-हरिणीं
विपद्यन्ते विश्वे विधि-शतमखाद्या दिविषदः ।
करालं यत् क्ष्वेलं कबलितवतः कालकलना
न शम्भोस्तन्मूलं तव जननि ताटङ्क महिमा
Saundarya Lahari 28

Oh! Goddess! even after taking amrita [nectar] which is capable of removing the dangerous ageing and death (jaraanara and marana), all devaas including Lords Brahma, Indra get destroyed during mahaa-pralaya. But you alone are the witness, Oh! Goddess! Who witness the taandava of Sadaa Siva. For Lord Siva, who consumed poison, there is no death or end and it is
because of your divine ear ring, Oh! Janani! According to Hindu rituals, widows wont wear ornaments specially earring. Shiva’s existence is protected by Devi’s earring. The tāṭaṅka were considered most auspicious by the married women in India. Even in the great dissolution, The Lord and Devi are there. They are the witness. We praise them as माता च पार्वती देवी पिता देवो महेश्वरः । My Mother is Devi Parvati, and my Father is Deva Maheswara (Shiva). It is the power of Devi’s tāṭaṅka that Maheshwara is One with out an end (Anashwara).

Lalita Sahasranama describes mainly three forms of Devi. Sthoolam (gross), Sookshmam (subtle) & Param (primordial). Sthoola means the visible form with hands and feet. We see idols and imagery of Devi, great Saints and Sages who exhibits Devi’s qualities, some are blessed to Her voice, yet others have heard the sound of Devi’s anklets. Many have had the vision of Devi in their dreams. Saints like Sambandhar as explained earlier had t blessings to get milk from the Mother. All these are the gross form.

In all mantras, Devi resides as the root cause. This is her subtle form. Those who chant the Mantras, practice and focus on the sounds are connected to the subtle form of Devi.

Param is the form without any attributes. Only with spiritual sadhana, hard penance and knowledge, one could grasp this form.
Om abhyāsātiśaya jñātāyai namaḥ
who is known only through the strenuous practice of spiritual discipline says Lalita Sahasranama. This means that only reak sadhaks and strenuous penance will lead to Devi’s blessings.
14:02
We praise the Lord as Jagan Niyantha, Jagadathmakascha. This means that God is the creation and one who sustains it. The creator and the creation are not separate. God has transformed Herself to this creation. It is also controlled and sustained by Her. Usually Creation (Srishti), Sustenance (Sthithi) and Dissolution (Samhara) are the three functions talked about in scriptures, in Lalita Sahasranama 5 functions are described. Disappearance (Thirodhanam) & Blessing (Anugraham) are the other two. They are known as Pañca Kṛtya.
Om pañca kṛtya parāyaṇāyai namaḥ
[who is devoted to the five functions]
The first mantra of Lalita Sahasranama, Om śrī mātre namaḥ denotes the creation, the second one, Om śrī mahā rājñyai namaḥ denotes the sustenance and the third one Om śrīmat siṁhāsaneśvaryai namaḥ denotes dissolution. All the mantras that follows are about the power of her illusion. The second last mantra, Om śiva śaktyaikya rūpiṇyai namaḥ denotes anugraham.

A true spiritual seeker analyses the world well through the grace of Mother and penance breaks out of the illusion and understands the entire creation is nothing but the union of Shiva & Shakti. This can be achieved through various paths of Sadhana, it can be that of Devotion (Bhakti), hence Devi is praised as
Om bhakti priyāyai namaḥ
[who is fond of (and pleased by) devotion.]
Om bhakti gamyāyai namaḥ
[who is attained only through devotion.]
Om bhakti vaśyāyai namaḥ
[who is to be won over by devotion.]
Om bhayāpahāyai namaḥ
[who dispels fear.]
Om śāmbhavyai namaḥ
[who is the wife of Sambhu (Shiva).]
in Lalita Sahasranama.

The path of Sadhana can be of the non-attribute one (Nirguna), hence Devi is praised as
Om nir guṇāyai namaḥ
[who is beyond all three gunas of nature, namely, Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas.]
Om niṣ kalāyai namaḥ
[who is without parts.]
Om śāntāyai namaḥ
[who is tranquil.]
Om niṣ kāmāyai namaḥ
[who is without desire.]
Om nir upaplavāyai namaḥ
[who is indestructible.]

The path of Sadhana can also be of Kundalini, hence Devi is praised as
Om kula kuṇḍālayāyai namaḥ
[who abides in Kulakunda (the center of Muladhara chakra).]
Om kaula mārga tatpara sevitāyai namaḥ and so on. There are amore than 70 mantras dedicated to this path in Lalita Sahasranama

The path of yoga Sadhana constituting various chakras namely Muladhara, Svadhishthana, Manipura, Anahata, Vishuddhi, Ajna, Sahasrara is also extensively described in Lalita Sahasranama.

Whether through Bhakti, Jnana, Yoga, sadhana, it is through excelling in Sadhana alone or a sadhak alone get the special blessings of Devi. That is why Devi is praised as
Om abhyāsātiśaya jñātāyai namaḥ
[who is known only through the strenuous practice of spiritual discipline] in Lalita Sahasranama.

Hence through Creation, Sustenance, Dissolution, Disappearance and Blessings (the 5 actions described in the previous episode). The truth disappears with the power of illusion and through the blessings of divine, the illusion is overcome and become enlightened. We understand that the entire creation is the union of Shiva & Shakti. #LalitaSahasranama in a nutshell points out that understanding this truth is the ultimate aim of one’s life.

Let us see about the story of manifestation of Goddess Lalita. The word Lalita has many meaning. The one who is beautiful is the most popular, laliteti sundaram. Another meaning is, one who can be approached by anyone, from small kids to the old aged ones.
Om ābāla gopa viditāyai namaḥ
[who is known well by all]
Devi is known by all, from the shepherds to the small kids. No much special wisdom, scriptural knowledge and any other eligibility is needed to go to Her. She can be achieved by pure devotion. Hence this name.

Once a demon king named Tharaka, started spreading havoc in all the worlds. He casted fear and sorrow to Devas and all the goodhearted ones.
यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत |
अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम् ||
Gita 4.7
Whenever there is a decline in righteousness and an increase in unrighteousness, at that time I manifest says Lord Krishna to Arjuna. There is. similar sloka in Devi Mahatmyam
इत्थं यदा यदा बाधा दानवोत्था भविष्यति
तदा तदावतीर्याहं करिष्याम्यरिसङ्क्षयम्
Devi Mahatmyam 11.54-55
whenever there is chaos and disturbances to the good people because of danavas (evil ones), I incarnate and eliminate the evil everytime.

So, when Tharakasura’s chaos became unbearable, the Devas started a sacrifice under the protection of Lord Vishnu. It was said in the puranas that this sacrifice continued for a very long time, around 4000 years. All the Devas were participating. Even after a strenuous and long yaga, Devi didn’t appear, at that time all the Gods started to sacrifice themselves to the pyre. From that fire, emanated the Divine Mother.
Om cid agni kuṇḍa sambhūtāyai namaḥ
[who was born in the fire pit of Pure Consciousness]
Om deva kārya samudyatāyai namaḥ
[who is intent on fulfilling the wishes of the gods.]

Om cid agni kuṇḍa sambhūtāyai namaḥ

Om deva kārya samudyatāyai namaḥ

All the Gods praised Devi. Tharakasura had attained a boon that only the son of Shiva & Parvati can slay him. Lord Shiva was in His penance after His consort Goddess Sati burnt away Her body in the great sacrifice of Daksha. Goddess Sati has reincarnated as Mother Parvati. Parvati was assisting Lord Shiva and the Lord was in an unshakable penance. All the devas thought, how can Shiva and Parvati bear a child if the Lord continues his penance like this? They devised a plan to send Kama Deva (the God of desire) to interrupt Lord Shiva’s penance. Kama Deva went to kailas and started shooting his floral arrow on Lord Shiva, the Lord was furious and opened His third eye and Kamadeva was burnt into ashes. The one who went to help devas is now nothing but dust. Gods were worried on thinking the state of the one who went to help them. A demi-god named Chitrasena gathered the ashes of kamadeva and made a form out of it. Not only it didn’t resembled kamadeva, but was heavily deformed. Since Lord Brahma did not create this form, seeing the deformity Lord Brahma mocked at it saying “Bhanda, Bhanda!” as the form was such. Thus that deformed figure turned into a daemon named Bhandasura. Since this form was the creation of the gods, each of them blessed him with various powers and weapons. He made a huge city named Shoonyaka Nagara aka Shonitapuram. In the beginning all the gods helped him, he was considered one among them. He had two brothers Vishukran & Vishangan. He had many sons. Unlike other asuras, they were devoted to Lord Shiva. They performed various sacrifices everyday for the prosperity of their kingdom. Because of all these they became highly powerful. It is an inherent quality of Asuras to harm Devas. Now, all this have started from trying a solution to slay Tharakasura but Bhandasura and his team has become more menace than Tharakusra. Nobody even bothered about Tharaka at the moment. All the Gods performed a strenuous and very long sacrifice and received the Grace of Mother Lalita. Mother appeared from the fire of their sacrifice and they narrated how they sent Kamadeva to shake Shiva’s penance for the purpose of slaying Tharama and he was turned into ashes and now has become Bhandasura. Mother have to slay him and bless us all. Mother assured tat She will slay Bhandasura.

Devi assured all the Gods to slay Bhandasura. They named Mother as Kameshwari, Lalitambika. Mother was married to Lord Kameshwara (Shiva). A huge kingdom was built and palace made of Chintamani (as mentioned in earlier episodes) were constructed for Devi. The city was names Sri Nagara as opposed to the Shunyaka Nagara of Bhandasura. All the devas were living in that city and after sometime Devi started to wage a war against Bhandasura. There were no devas other than Lord Kameshwara in Devi’s army. The entire army was created by Devi which came to be known as Shakti Sena.
Om bhaṇḍāsura vadhodyukta śakti senā samanvitāyai namaḥ
[who is endowed with an army of shaktis intent on slaying Bhandasura.]

Goddess Sampatkari was in-charge of the elephantry.
Om sampatkarī samārūḍha sindhura vraja sevitāyai namaḥ
[who is attended by a herd of elephants ably commanded by Sampatkari.]

Goddess Ashvarudha was in-charge of the cavalry.
Om aśvārūḍhādhiṣṭhitāśva koṭi koṭibhir āvṛtāyai namaḥ
[who is surrounded by a cavalry of several million horses which are under the command of the shakti Ashvarudha.]

Om cakra rāja rathārūḍha sarvāyudha pariṣkṛtāyai namaḥ
[who shines in Her chariot Chakraraja, equipped with all kinds of weapons.]

Om geya cakra rathārūḍha mantriṇī pari sevitāyai namaḥ
[who is served by the shakti Mantrini riding the Geyachakra chariot.]
14:28
Om kiri cakra rathārūḍha daṇḍanāthā puras kṛtāyai namaḥ
[who is escorted by the shakti Dandanatha, seated in the Kirichakra chariot.]

Om bhaṇḍa putra vadhodyukta bālā vikrama nanditāyai namaḥ
[who delights in seeing the valor of the goddess Bala who is intent on killing the sons of Bhanda.]
As per the custom the sons of Bhandasura came for the war first. A war of unseen scale was fought.

Mantrinin Devi (The Chief Minister) killed Vishukran and Dandanatha Devi killed Vishangan, the brothers of Bhandasura
Devi’s daughter Bala Tripurasundari killed the sons of Bhandasura.

Goddess Jwalamalini made a huge wall of fire to protect the Shakti Sena. Lord Ganapati destroyed all the Vighna Yantras made by the asuras. When th evignhna yantras were placed by the asuras, the shakti sena lost the enthusiasm for war and became lazy. It is when Lord Ganapati intervened and destroyed all the vighna yantras. Mother was happy and blessed Ganapati with Her glance. Bhandasura took 10 incarnations named Ravana, Kumbhakarna, Duryodhana, Dushasana, Dantavaktra etc. From the fingernails of Devi, manifested the 10 avatars of Lord Vishnu. Sri Rama, Sri Krishna, Balarama, Parasurama, Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, etc. killed the demons named Hiranyaksya and so on.

Om karāṅguli nakhotpanna nārāyaṇa daśākṛtyai namaḥ
[who created from Her fingernails all ten incarnations of Narayana (Vishnu).]

Using a special weapon named Maha Pashupata, Devi destroyed the entire asura army. Using another special weapon named Kameshwarastra, Devi destroyed Bhandasura and his city.

Om kāmeśvarāstra nirdagdha sabhaṇḍāsura śūnyakāyai namaḥ
[who burned and destroyed Bhandasura and his capital Shunyaka with the mighty Kameshvara missile.]

All the Gods & Goddesses praised Devi
Om brahmopendra mahendrādi deva saṁstuta vaibhavāyai namaḥ
[whose many powers are extolled by Brahma, Vishnu, Siva, and other gods.]

The huge story of slaying Bhandasura and the great war is described in a nutshell in Lalita Sahasranama starting from
bhaṇḍāsura vadhodyukta śakti senā samanvitā to brahmopendra mahendrādi deva saṁstuta vaibhavā

This Lalita Sahasranama Stotra composed by the Vashinyadi Vagdevis should be chanted with utmost reverence by all of us. After the daily morning routines, and practices, Sri Chakra puja should be performed before chanting Lalita Sahasranama. There are many rules in scriptures on how to and how not to chant Lalita Sahasranama.

गीती शीघ्री शिरःकम्पी तथा लिखितपाथकः ।
अनर्थज्ञोऽल्पकण्ठश्च षडेतेपाठकाधमाः ॥
Pāṇinīya Sikşā 32

Those who recite the mantras in a singsong manner, (too) quickly, with a nodding of the head, use a written text at the time of recitation, do not know the meaning of passages read, and have a low voice, are six kinds of bad reciters


Lalita Sahasranama shouldn’t be chanted like a song or too much musical (1.Geeti). We shouldn’t boast that “I had to go to office or catch the train, hence I completed the entire Lalita Sahasranama in just 5 minutes!”. (2.Sheeghri) One shouldn’t unnecessarily shake the head or look here and there while chanting Lalita Sahasranama. We can see sometime people chanting while having a sip of tea.(3.Shirahkambi) It is considered the most lowest grade of act to read a book. The mantras should be recited from memory (4.Likhitha Patakah). In India there was a custom of staying in a temple for a longer period of time to do spiritual practices. One used to live according to the temple rules and have only the prasad. Lalita Sahasranama was an integral part of such practices. Ayurveda physicians and other practitioners also considered Lalita Sahasranama as a path of worship. Hence all of them had memorized the mantras and chanted flawlessly. It is also not good to chant the mantras without understanding the meaning as well (5.Anartho). It should not be chanted in a feeble voice that the listeners are not able to hear. (6.Alpakanta ) . These are t e6 ways one should not chant Lalita Sahasranama. Then how to chant? Just do the opposite of what is mentioned above.

माधुर्यमक्षरव्यक्तिः पदच्छेदस्तुसुस्वरः ।
धैर्यं लयसमर्थं च षडेतेपाठका गुणाः ॥
Pāṇinīya Sikşā 33

Sweetness, clearness, separation of words, right accent, patience and ability to observe time are six merits in a reciter
14:42
When one chants Lalita Sahasranama, it should be soothing and the voice should be sweet. Each syllable should be chanted perfectly. utmost care should be taken on how to split the phrases. Lalita Sahasranama should be chanted in the best of the note we can. When one chants understanding the meaning of each word and in the right sense, the listeners understands how seriously that person has taken up this task of chanting. One’s mind should merge with the chanting. The chief pontiff of Sringeri Sarada Peetham, Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati was once chanting Lalita Sahasranama, while he was chanting the mantra Om tat pada lakṣyārthāyai namaḥ, he remembered the lotus feet of the Mother. He went into Samadhi instantly for 2-3 hours and could continue chanting only after that. This is known as laya. Hence chanting by understanding the essence will benefit us immensely.

Lalita Sahasranama
https://youtu.be/lTFrbSUs58U

We can see many aspects of knowledge in Lalita Sahasranama. They are mainly classified in to the following subject matters. It starts with Keshadi Pada (Head to TOe) description of Devi followed by the palace and the city where Devi resides. Next comes the war and slaying of Bhandasura. We could see Mantra Shastra next like Sri Vidya Upasana, Kaula Marga, Dakshinachara, Vamachara, etc. If we look into Lalita Sahasranama deeply, we could see that it is an infinite ocean of knowledge. We could say that there is nothing that has not been touched upon. The famous commentator, Bhaskararaya in his commentary Saubhagyabhaskaram, has pointed out that Lalita Sahasranama is having mentions about 170 topics from various Indian scriptures. Only if one understands the entire Indian knowledge system well, then only he will be able to appreciate Lalita Sahasranama in its entirety. It is said to be be so expansive and deep.

As said earlier, Vashinyadi Vagdevis are said to the Rishis who has composed Lalita Sahasranama. In Sanskrit, there are 51 letters, but the most auspicious 32 were only used in Lalita Sahasranama.
Om śuddha vidyāṅkurākāra dvija paṅkti dvayojjvalāyai namaḥ
[who has radiant teeth which resemble the buds of pure knowledge.]
Devi’s teeth is compared to pure knowledge. Whatever Devi utters, they are the core philosophy of Veda & Vendantas. There are 32 teeth that represents the first letters of Lalita Sahasranama mantras. Vashinyadi Vagevi’s are considered the presiding goddesses for each of the 32 sounds. It is believed that the mantras with each of the sounds are composed by each Vagdevis who represent each sound. The vagdevi named Vashini is the presiding goddess for the sound अ / ‘A’, hence the mantras that start with syllable अ like Om ambāyai namaḥ were considered to be composed by Vashini. Like this the vagdevis divided the composition of Lalita Sahasranama and conceived the mantras that describes the best of the qualities of Devi.

पूजनीया जनैर्देवि स्थाने स्थाने पुरे पुरे |
गृहे गृहे शक्तिपरैः ग्रामे ग्रामे वने वने ||
Everyone in every house should worship Devi as She is the most auspicious. Whatever be the status, age, or varna everyone should worship Devi. In which place should one worship Her? It can be in a temple or in our own heart. It can be through an idol or an image, it can be through whatever means. In each villages, or even while going to forest. When you are in any trouble or not, when you are happy or sad, one should chant Devi’s mantra.

There are exactly 1000 names in Lalita Sahasranama. Using a special aphorism known as Chalaakshara Sutra it is pre-determined how to chant the mantras. Hence it is not needed to add or reduce anything. In many other stotras, it is said that it contains 1000 names but we could see that it is not so. Sometimes it might be more than 1000 or less. The same way with 108 names as well. We cannot see any such defects in Lalita Sahasranama. No meaningless words is used. Some syllables like cha, tu , hi, eva etc are used in Sanskrit to complete some words. We cannot see even a single word like that in Lalita Sahasranama. Even this is praising Devi(the feminine aspect), we can see many masculine sounds like
guṇa nidhi, ātma, roga parvata dambholir, mahā lāvaṇya śevadhi and neutral sounds like tat, brahma, paramdhama, sadhu, paramjyoti. Svāhā, Svāhā are avyayas. Everything else is feminine sounds.

Understanding the Lalita Sahasranama well will help us to pronounce it in a better way. We see many people making mistakes while chanting Lalita Sahasranama. Especially the mantras like
Om annadāyai namaḥ
Om vasudāyai namaḥ
Om vṛddhāyai namaḥ

The stress ‘yai’ at the end of these mantras are very important otherwise it would mistaken as masculine but they are not.

But mantras like
Om svāhāyai namaḥ
Om svadhāyai namaḥ

can also be chanted as
Om svāhā namaḥ
Om svadhā namaḥ as they are avyayas.

We had seen earlier, how Devi annihilated Bhandasura.
Om kāmeśvarāstra nirdagdha sabhaṇḍāsura śūnyakāyai namaḥ
[who burned and destroyed Bhandasura and his capital Shunyaka with the mighty Kameshvara missile.]
Om hara netrāgni sandagdha kāma sañjīvanauṣadhyai namaḥ
[who became the life giving medicine for Kamadeva (the god of love) who had been burned to ashes by the fire from Siva’s eye.]
Kamadeva was reborn again and unlike earlier, his form was not visible to everyone, only his wife, Sati Devi could see his form. He regained all his powers and charms. Kamadeva became a celebrated devotee of Mother. He had devised many aspects of Devi worship. There are many mantras of Devi attributed to Kamadeva.

Om brahmopendra mahendrādi deva saṁstuta vaibhavāyai namaḥ
[whose many powers are extolled by Brahma, Vishnu, Siva, and other gods.]
All the gods praised Devi. Brahma, Upendra, Indra etc.

Let us see explanation for the following mantras
Om śrīmad vāgbhava kūṭaika svarūpa mukha paṅkajāyai namaḥ
[whose lotus face is the auspicious vagbhavakuta (the first five syllables of the panchadasakshari mantra).]
Om kaṇṭhādhaḥ kaṭi paryanta madhya kūṭa svarūpiṇyai namaḥ
[who from Her neck to Her waist is of the form of the madhyakuta (the middle six syllables of the panchadasakshari mantra).]
Om śakti kūṭaikatāpanna kaṭyadhobhāga dhāriṇyai namaḥ
[whose form below the waist is the shaktikuta (the last four syllables of the panchadasakshari mantra).]

Earlier we had discussed about the gross form of Devi. The form with hands, legs etc. The sthoola rupa. Now we are entering from the gross to the subtle (sookshma) form of Devi. We study the scriptures in a sequential method. We call it as Sakha-Arundathi Nyaya. If one has to be taught about a star, first the master will point to a tree, then the branch of that tree, then the space between the branches, followed by a galaxy and then the brightest star in the galaxy. Only then the student would be able to understand the subject well. In the beginning, one cannot teach him directly pointing towards the star. The same way, in Lalita Sahasranama first Devi’s gross form, Her abode, palace, the throne and tings that we cold grasp easily were described first. Now slowly we are entering to the next level.

It is Devi’s inherent quality to protect the good and destroy the evil. In Devi Mahatmya it is said
इत्थं यदा यदा बाधा दानवोत्था भविष्यति
तदा तदावतीर्याहं करिष्याम्यरिसङ्क्षयम्
Devi Mahatmyam 11.54-55
whenever there is chaos and disturbances to the good people because of danavas (evil ones), I incarnate and eliminate the evil every time. Accordingly, Bhandasura was also killed. All these feats of Devi is attributed to Her gross form.

As said earlier, Sthoolam, Sookshmam, param are various forms of Devi. The same way we could perceive the idols in a temple or great mahatmas, when we progress in spiritual sadhana, we could perceive Devi’s sookshma roopa. For a visible form, we usually describe the face first then from the face to the waist and so on. In the same way for the subtle form formed by mantras also are described from head to toe. The form is divided into three; vagbhavakuta, madhyakuta & sakthikuta. We can see the same in the 3 mantras mentioned earlier.
Vagbhavakuta: the facial parts
Madhyakuta: the parts from throat to waist
Sakthikuta: the parts below the waist

This mantras were transferred in oral tradition from the master to the disciple not read from the books. Only if the master gives the mantras as deeksha will that become beneficial. I’m still reciting the mantra here for us to have a brief idea of what it is.
क ए इ ल ह्रीं (Vagbhavakuta)
ह स क ह ल ह्रीं (Madhyakuta)
स क ल ह्रीं (Sakthikuta)
The same way a visible form have these three parts, mantras too have.

Lalita Sahasranama
https://youtu.be/PXU2PwkEJZw
15:12
Lalita Sahasranama says Devi has emerged from the fire pit of Pure Consciousness. cid agni kuṇḍa sambhūtā. It is Devi’s face that was seen first. Sound and the words dissipates from the face. Face means mouth also. That’s why the first part of the mantra, क ए इ ल ह्रीं is known as Vagbhavakuta. ह स क ह ल ह्रीं, the form of Devi from the neck to the waist is known as Madhyakuta. स क ल ह्रीं, the last part below the waist is known as Saktikuta. Mantra has mainly three aspects; mananam, dharanam or thrananam. Mananam means thinking repeatedly one object or subject and becoming one with that. Thrananam means uplifting or escaping from three types of pains. From birth to death, from the mother’s womb to the coffin, we are experiencing various types of sufferings. The three types of suffering we undergo because of the materialistic world, the nature, from supernatural powers are known as Tapa trayas (1. Adibautika, 2. Adi Daivika 3. Adhyatmika ). By understanding and chanting the mantras in the right way, we can be liberated from the tapa trayas. Mananat-trayate iti Mantrah. By the Manana (constant thinking or recollection) of which one is protected or is released from the round of births and deaths, is Mantra.

How could we escape from this cycles of birth and rebirths (samsara)? The only path is the one that is shown to us by our guru. The most important among those is the mantra that we receive from the master. We need to progress from the gross to the subtle aspect after receiving the mantra deeksha from a guru.The mantra needs to be chanted and contemplated during whatever actions we are indulged in. We should remember our favourite aspect of the divine (ishta murthi). Then only we will be liberated from the ocean of samsara, reminds the mantra
śrīmad vāgbhava kūṭaika svarūpa mukha paṅkajā
[whose lotus face is the auspicious vagbhavakuta (the first five syllables of the panchadasakshari mantra).]
This part is describing about the mantra form of Devi. The coming parts of Lalita Sahasranama is also mentioning about the subtle form.

It is impossible to perceive the subtle form with the external senses. It is only possible using our mind. Only through manana and dhyana (meditation) we could understand that aspect.
kulāmṛtaika rasikāyai [who is especially fond of the nectar known as kula.]
kula saṅketa pālini [who protects the code of rituals of the path of yoga known as Kula.]
kulāṅganā [who is well born (who is from a good family).]
kulāntasthā [who resides in Kulavidya.]
kaulini [who belongs to the Kula.]
kula yogini [who is the deity in the Kulas.]
akulā [who does not have a family.]
samayāntasthā [who resides inside Samaya (mental worship).]
samayācāra tatparā [who is attached to the Samaya form of worship.]

These are the next set of description on Devi’s form. If we understand the meaning of the two words ‘kulam’ and ‘akulam’, we will be able to easily grasp the essence of this entire part. One meaning of ’ku’ in Sanskrit is earth. There are 6 adharas / cardinal energy centres in our body. Mooladhara, Svadisthana, Manipura, Anahata, Vishudhi & Ajna.
Above these 6 adharas lies the 1000 petaled lotus named Sahasrara. At the centre of sahasrara is teh abode of Shiva & Parvati. One’s focus should be to realize that Shiva & Sakti. I’m explaining the meaning of the word ‘kula’. Muladhara symbolises the principle of prthvi (earth). The word ‘kulam’ is derived from this concept. kula kuṇḍālayā, who abides in Kulakunda (the center of Muladhara chakra).
15:12
Kunda as in Homa Kunda means a pit in which things can stay. Scriptures say that the Kundalini sakti , our vital life force stays dormant in the form of a serpent in the muladhara chakra. Through Bhakti, Yoga Sadhana & Knowledge this kundalini wakes-up and slowly climbs through various chakras from muladhara to svadhisthana, Manipura, Anahata, Vishudhi & Ajna and finally reaches the Sahasrara. Then the union of our life force with Shiva & Sakti happens. In fact, they are not two, we cannot separate Shiva from Sakti. It is said that there are 72,000 Nāḍīs (the sibtle energy channels) in our body. When the Kundalini reaches the Sahasrara, all the channels overflows with Amrit (ambrosia), the eternal life force.
sudhā sārābhi varṣiṇi
[who pours out streams of ambrosia.]
This stream of abrosia liberates one from jiva. The cycle of birth and death is broken.

There won’t be any change in the physical appearance of such people. But they won’t be the same again. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa uses an anecdote to explain this. A burnt rope will have the shape of the rope. But one cannot use that to tie anything. In the same way, the liberated souls are no more an ordinary person. Each words, actions, breath and their presence is beneficial to everyone in the world. Each word of them becomes the word of God. Their glance becomes that of God. Even each breath of their’s are for the good of others. So the word ‘kulam’ indicated muladhara and the path through sushumna to the sahasrara. ‘akulam’ indicated the Sahasrara, that is above all the 6 adharas. Devi abides in Kulakunda (the center of Muladhara chakra), indicated by the mantra kula kuṇḍālayā.

kaula mārga tatpara sevitā
[who is worshipped by those devoted to the Kaula tradition.]
Devi appreciates those who choose the path of kaula.

A path that is not of kaula is also mentioned in the mantras akulā, samayāntasthā, samayācāra tatparā

Devi is described as abhyāsātiśaya jñātā [who is known only through the strenuous practice of spiritual discipline]. Once a devotee asked Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, “If the self is there in everybody and if there is nothing other than the Self, then where is the need for Sadhana? Just by sitting idle, we could realise isn’t it?”. Maharshi replied “It is not so. Only with severe penance of day and night (tapas), will you be able to achieve self-realisation.” Hence Devi can be known only through abhyāsa - atiśaya, strenuous practice of spiritual discipline. Sitting idle, doing nothing wii not benefit. Only ideal sadhaks will be able to receive Devi’s complete Grace. They are the ones who constantly adore Her. This is what the above mantra denotes. One side Devi is mentioned as sulabhā gati, [who is attained through a bright and easy path], Lalita Sahasranama also describes Devi as durgamā [who is approachable only with extreme effort.] Only with pure practices, devotion, strength of imagination and through constant reflection Devi can be attained.

The next subject of Lalita Sahasranama gives utmost importance to Bhakti. This section starts with bhavāni - bhāvanāgamyā [ the wife of Shiva who is attainable through imagination or thought]. Lalita Sahasranama praises Devi as bhakti priyā [who is fond of (and pleased by) devotion.], bhakti gamyā [who is attained only through devotion.], bhakti vaśyā [who is to be won over by devotion.] etc.

कलौ पापौग भगुले धर्मानुष्ठान वर्जिथे
This is how Dharma of kaliyuga is explained. The majority of the people are not interested in living in accordance with the rules of Dharma. A hundred ears ago, Bharata did not have so many and such good roads, electricity was sparse and infrequent, there were no computers, emails or phones, and there were not so many high rise apartments or houses either. There were no such comforts and convenience that we enjoy today. But our forefathers had a glow of inner peace on their countenance. Though they lacked our conveniences, they had dharma that we lack now. They had something that is missing from our lives. It was the awareness of Dharma and the practice of Dharma in their everyday lives. This is the difference between us and our forefathers. Only Dharma can bring eternal contentment. All of us, each living being is on a quest for joy and comfort. But the joy gained through money or by drinking alcohol or through any such worldly objects is short-lived. For eternal peace, we ned to practice Dharma in our lives. The pleasure gained through money and material possessions is artificial. It comes from the possession of something that is external and temporary. But for an. unchanging happiness, a life lived in accordance with Dharma is essential.
सुखं च न विना धर्मात्तस्माद्धर्मपरो भवेत्
Ashtānga Hridayam 2.20
Pleasure is not obtained without Dharma. So everyone must be Dharmic says scriptures.
Hence, we are going to discuss about Bhakti, a major component of Dharma.

Let me narrate an incident from the life of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Once a man asked him, “ why is it that the common man cannot attain God?” He smilingly replied, “Who cries for the Lord? They cry to gain comfort, for the sake of their kith and kin, for the sake of money, for many other things.If t hey had cried even for a minute to gain God, they would have definitely attained God.But nobody is doing it, so what can I do?” Here in the mantras bhakti priyā, bhakti gamyā, bhakti vaśyā, the greatness of Bhakti is extolled. The word Bhakti is derived from Sanskrit root “Bhaj”. The common meaning is to praise God, to serve God and to become absorbed in His thoughts. Sankaracharya also advises everyone,
भज गोविन्दं भज गोविन्दं गोविन्दं भज मूढमते ।
Bhaja Govindam 1

Instead of embracing worldly objects, our intelligence should embrace the Lord, reminds Sri Sankara. The love that we have for impermanent worldly objects, if transformed into eternal and indivisible God, that is known as Bhakti.
सा त्वस्मिन् परप्रेमरूपा
Narada Bhakti Sutra 2
The awareness of the true self is Bhakti
14:57
स्व स्वरूपानुसन्धानं भक्तिरित्यभिधीयथे
Ramana Maharshi
Reflection on one's own Self is called Bhakti

People might think that performing pujas and other rituals can be called Bhakti. But, narada in his Bhakti Sutra says Bhakti is absolute Love.

Once, the music legend Tyagaraja Swami went to another classical music concert. The performer was an expert musician, but the sweetness of Bhakti was lacking in his music. After this incident, Thyagaraja swami composed a song and it goes like this
సంగీత జ్ఞానము భక్తి వినాF
saṅgīta jñānamu bhakti vinā
Mere knowledge of music bereft of devotion

Music is not mere virtuosity of the vocal cords. A hymn is not a mere cacophony of sound. The sweetness and melody of its music lies in the intensity of devotion with which it is sung. It is that which gives life to it. Bhakti itself can be of two types. Nishta Bhakti & Para Bhakti. Another way of terming it is Apara Bhakti & para Bhakti. Mirabhai and Andal were completely absorbed in the Lord 24X7, oblivious to the world. They were able to traverse the joy and sorrow and each circumstance of their life with their state of Bhakti. This kind of devotion is known as Para Bhakti. I is not natural for many people. For the ordinary people, is prescribed the route of discipline, faith and observing customs. They must go on regular pilgrimages, keep their body clean, wear clean clothes, be regular in their prayers and in the chanting of Lalita Sahasranama and other stotras, chant their mantra, contemplate and deliberate on spiritual sayings. Gradually they will develop Para Bhakti. we must tunr to God for anything other than Bhakti. Our prayer to God must become a prayer for gaining this Para Bhakti (absolute devotion). There are nine aspects of Bhakti mentioned in the scriptures,
श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णो: स्मरणं पादसेवनम् ।
अर्चनं वन्दनं दास्यं सख्यमात्मनिवेदनम् ॥ 
śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam
arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma-nivedanam
Srimad Bhāgavatam 7.5.23

Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Viṣṇu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship with sixteen types of paraphernalia, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one’s best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him (in other words, serving Him with the body, mind and words) 

Amma gives a beautiful example of this aspect. She talks of women with small children who are working in various jobs in metropolitan cities like Bombay. They might be typing something, or in the computer, or doing office work, In the midst of all these jobs, their thoughts will be constantly with their small child. Did it drink milk, is the baby awake and crying? There is not even a second when the child is not in their thoughts. Their child will be in their thoughts, in the midst of all their work. This is Smarana Bhakti. Whatever we do, keep an unbroken remembrance of the Lord, For the Gopikas of Vrindavan, the remembrance of the Lord was unbroken and uppermost in their minds.

The next one is Pada Sevanam, serving the feet of the Lord or the Guru or perform actions in obedience to the instructions of the Guru. Live in accordance with the dharma that is given in the scriptures and by the Guru. Worship or perform archana to the Lord with flowers.

Vandanam- always prostrate to the Lord in your mind, with faith and reverence. The Lord is infinitely glorious. It is said that when the gopas, who was totally unaware of his glory played with Lord Krishna, the celestial beings also developed an intense longing to play with the Lord. They saw the gopas leaping over Sri Krishna tumbling on the ground with him, but when they came near to the Lord, they were unable to touch him. Because, it was Maha Vishnu himself who had taken on the form of Sri Krishna, and devas were aware of the fact. So they were unable to touch him. So, we must never forget the glory of mahatmas, or Devi Herself, even though She can be easily attained by Her devotees (Bhakta Sulabha). Therefore, our attitude must always be one of adoration, of prostration. It must be evident in our each and every movement. We must constantly remember their infinite glory.

Dasyam - Be of service to the Mahatmas and Great brings. Take care of their objects and institutions. Take care of their needs. Serve their devotees. Sakhyam is being a der friend to God. Atma Nivedanam is Self-Surrender. These are the nine forms of Bhakti. The most important aspect of Bhakti is Love. There is a song in Tamil that describes about this story. There was a man called Sakkiya Nayanar, who worshipped Lord Shiva by throwing stones at the Linga. But Lord Shiva accepted each stone thrown at him as if it was a flower. Arjuna stuck the Lord with his bow, Gandeevam, But the Lord accepted the blow without any sorrow. There was another man who hit the Lord with a stick, and the Lord accepted that as well. Kannappa Nayanar would take water in his mouth and spit it out as abhisheka on the idol of Lord Shiva. He kept his sandals on top of Shiva Linga. He would first bite and taste the food, before he offered it to Lord Shiva. Shabari bit into the wild fruit and tested its sweetness before she offered it to Lord Rama. The Lord only sees our heart. It is our heart that we must offer to the Lord. That os called Bhakti or devotion.

Arjuna asked the Lord about the signs of a true devotee. The Lord is explaining this in the Bhakti Yoga of the Bhagavad Gita. The Lord did not talk about any external object. There are people who are devotees of Amma, of Ayyappa, of Guruvayurappa. For example in Amma’s Ashram we say Aum Namah Shivaya, in another ashram the greeting is Hari Aum, those who are going to Sabarimala will say Swamiye Sharanam Ayyappa, Guruvayur is infused with the chanting of Narayana. Some wear white clothes, Ayyappa devotees wear black, some wear saffron. Some people shave their head, some have a top knot and others have a back knot. Some grow beards, some are clean shaven and yet others have matted hair. Arjuna asks the Lord about the signs of a devotee. In Bhagavad Gita, the Lord did not give the sign of a devotee as one who wears yellow clothes or green clothes or black clothes. The Lord is explaining to Arjuna the values of life that should be borne in mind, We can buy a Rudraksha, Tulsi chain, Crystal chain etc in a shop. Hair is grown and cut in a barber shop. What is important is not the name by which we call God, but the intention behind the prayer. In what Bhava (attitude of mind) are we worshipping God? These are the signs of devotion. The Lord gives 36 virtues as the signs of a devotee. The fact that we love God is one aspect of it. It is also important to understand who is dearest to God. Loving God is like a one way street. God must also love us. The Lord enumerates the qualities of a devotee in Bhakti Yoga. He describes 36 virtues and explains that “such devotees are dear to me.”

अद्वेष्टा सर्वभूतानां मैत्र: करुण एव च |
निर्ममो निरहङ्कार: समदु:खसुख: क्षमी ||

सन्तुष्ट: सततं योगी यतात्मा दृढनिश्चय: | मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्यो मद्भक्त: स मे प्रिय: ||

यस्मान्नोद्विजते लोको लोकान्नोद्विजते च य: | हर्षामर्षभयोद्वेगैर्मुक्तो य: स च मे प्रिय: ||

अनपेक्ष: शुचिर्दक्ष उदासीनो गतव्यथ: | सर्वारम्भपरित्यागी यो मद्भक्त: स मे प्रिय: || Bhagavad Gita 12.13-16

As much as I love the Lord, I should also understand whom the Lord considers dearest to him. The one who bears no anger to anyone. adveṣhṭā sarva-bhūtānāṁ. Ordinary men have three types of emotions or sentiments. The first type is love. We love the ones who are dear to us. We bear anger towards the ones that we not like. An we are indifferent and cold towards people whom we consider to be beneath us. The Lord does not require us to love everybody. If a drunkard comes in front of us, we will be unable to love him. If we see a cobra in front of us, we will try to distance ourselves for our own safety. That is why he said “The one who bears no anger”. Instead of being controlled by the three emotions of love, anger and indifference, with no anger towards any one, Instead of looking only at the outer surface and dissimilarities of all beings, he is one who sees in all of creation the true self and strength of God. He bears an attitude of friendship to all. People feel that if they become devotees or spiritual seekers, they should stop smiling, talking and interacting with others. But the Lord’s advice is contrary to this feeling fostered by spiritual seekers. We must behave with goodwill, kindness and friendship to each and everyone. We must not harbour hatred towards anyone. We must speak amicably to them. We must interact with them and help them.

Mahatmas tell us that when we see people in distress, we must, out of our own volition, help them. This is why Devi has the names

dayā murti [who is the personification of compassion]

avyāja karuṇā murti [who is pure compassion]

sāndra karuṇā [who shows intense compassion.]

The next quality of the devotee dearest to the Lord is “karuna”, the one with compassion.

अद्वेष्टा सर्वभूतानां मैत्र: करुण एव च |
निर्ममो निरहङ्कार: समदु:खसुख: क्षमी || Bhagavad Gita 12.13

The thought that I am the body must become transformed to the realization that I am a part of the divine, I am the servant of God. We must become free of ego. We must become free of pride. When happiness enters life and also when unexpected sorrow befalls us as a result
02:29
of our prarabda karma consider it to be a blessing from God. We have been blessed in so many ways. The Lord has helped me through every stage if my life. But due to some reason, this sorrow has befallen me. This sorrow will also leave me with the passage of time. sama-duḥkha-sukhaḥ kṣhamī. Devotion is. The development, the blooming forth and nurturing of the right values. This is what Lord says in the Bhagavad Gita.

Bhakti or Devotion should also come under the scrutiny of scriptural sciences. It should not be confined to an intellectual scrutiny. The love for god should be constant, it is a sentiment that should absorb us, every moment of our lives. The word bhakti brings to my mind the names of countless devotees. The Nayanmar and Alwars of Tamil Nadu, Poonthanam and Bhattathiri in Kerala, great sages and saints like Ramanuja Swamigal, Shri Shankaracharaya, Raghavendra devotees like Bhadrachala Ramadasan, Purandaradasa, Eknath Maharaj, Tukaram Maharaj, Jnaneshwar, Andaal and Bhakta Meera, Tyagaraja Swamigal, Muthu Swamideekshithar, Shyama Shastry, Chitanya Mahaprabhu, Shri Ramakrishna Paramahamsar, who spent all twenty-four hours absorbed in prayer and who infused their love of prayer into the world. We must learn about their lives, understand the values that they lived by and emulate and be guided by those values and qualities in our lives also.

There was a monk Named Bodhendra in the lineage of Adishankara. Let me recount an incident of his life. Like the great saints and sages of yore, he travelled all over Bharatam (India). He reached North India. In those times, wayfarers usually sleep on the open verandas of houses. He rested on the veranda of a house. Something happened the next day. A Brahmin lady and her wife, who came from the Dravida Land, were going on a pilgrimage to Kashi. They were ambushed by Muslims and the woman was abducted. She was raped by them. She somehow managed to escape from their clutches and reached Kashi. She met her Brahmin husband. He did not know what to do with his wife who was victimised by the muslims. Jagannath Pandit was the greatest scholar of those times. Everybody that Brahmin went to for advice told him that there was no penance that would atone for such a sin. They advised him to accept the counsel of Jagannath Pandit. The lady pleaded with him “you need not accept me as your wife, but at least allow me to remain with you as your servant.” I shall do the house hold chores and keep myself alive.” Thus both the Brahmin and his wife went to take the counsel of Jagannath Pandit. Jagannath Pandit is seated inside his house Bhodendra Swami was sitting on the veranda of the house, but the other three were unaware of his presence. The woman recounted all that had happened. “I am now a sinner. How can I atone for my sins?” The pandit said, “It is enough if you chant the name of Rama thrice , chant, Rama Rama Rama. That is sufficient, and then you may bathe in the holy river of Ganga. You will be cleansed of all sin.” There was a loud shout from inside. It was the mother of Jagannath Pandit , “What did you just say?” He went inside, O Mother, did I utter anything wrong? “Will not the utterance of the holy name Rama be salvation from her sins?” His mother said, “You asked her to chant his name thrice. Why should she have to chant it thrice? Isn’t a single utterance of his name sufficient to free her from every single sin that has been committed?” He replied “For my father, with his strong ascetic practices (Tapas), meditation and self-discipline, it was sufficient to utter “Rama” only once. But I wanted to free from the “ Three forms of sorrow” and hence advised her to chant the holy name of Rama Thrice. “It is true, I made a mistake, I need have asked her to chant “Rama” only once for her salvation.” Bodhendra Swami, who was able to hear the conversation, was extremely happy. The Brahmin lady came back from her bath in the holy Ganges, absolved from all sin. Swami Bodhendra accepted alms from their home.
04:43
Later on, he wrote a book called “Bhagvan-nama-rasodayam” in which he advises the people who live in Kaliyuga, which is steeped in sin, to remain absorbed in chanting the name of the lord, to read the Lalita Sahasranama, to constantly reflect on the meaning and essence of the Sahasranama and the concept embedded in it as the only means for liberation. His “namasiddhantham” the theory of salvation by means of chanting. It was Bhodendra swamigal, Sridhara Ayyaval and Marudhanallur Sadhguru Swamigal who evolved the traditional Bhajans. The Bhajans praise all gods and goddesses. He lived in the village of Govindapuram near Thanjavoor. Later on, he became the head of the Kanchi Math. It was he who was responsible in popularizing the chanting of the divine name of the Lord and singing the devotional songs (sampradaya bhajans). Bhajan is an outer and visible expression of our devotion to God. Bhajans are sung with great devotion, eye overflowing with tears of love, words catching in our throat, with fervour, lost in the memory of the Lord. We shall continue with the glorious attributes of Devi, in the coming days.

Bhaskararaya, the great scholar, wrote a brilliant commentary on Lalita Sahasranama in a book entitled “Saubagya Bhaskareeyam”. Let me tell you about 2 incidents in his life. One day he was sitting in the veranda of a house. He was silently chanting the names of the Devi. He was absorbed in the thought of Devi and he failed to notice a sanyasi walking by on the road in front of the house. He did not as was the custom, stand up and prostrate before the sanyasi. The sanyasi felt affronted. He spread the word that Bhaskararaya was a prideful snob. ‘He lacks humility, he is not a good man’. One day the two met each other in a temple. Bhaskararaya understood the hurt pride of the sanyasi, as he was a ‘Sarvajna’ (all knowing). In front of everybody, he took from the sanyasi his walking stick. He laid the stick down on the ground and prostrated before it. It is said that the stick blazed up and then was reduced to ashes. This demonstrates the strength and nobility of worshippers of Devi.

In another incident, he was performing a fire ritual of exceptional grandeur in Kashi. He was a profound worshipper of Devi, because of his profundity and grace, there were some who had harboured enmity towards him. They spread malicious slander against him. An assembly was held, in which the main speaker was Kumkumananda Nadhar Swami, it was said that even if he put ashes or sandal paste on his forehead it would be transformed into kumkum, he was also an ardent worshipper of Devi. The assembly met in his presence. These men who harboured animosity towards Bhaskararaya, probed his knowledge with many questions. Being a profound scholar, who had mastered all the scriptural texts, Bhaskararaya had no difficulty in answering their questions. Finally, in order to defeat him, they took the mantra, mahā catuḥ ṣaṣṭi koṭi yoginī gaṇa sevitā [who is attended by six hundred forty million yoginis]. They asked Bhaskararaya to give the names of the 64 crore Yoginis, they thought that the great scholar would accept defeat. He meditated upon the goddess, her grace and compassion flowed towards him. Each of the yoginis serving Devi appeared to him and whispered their name, form and the weapons with which they served Devi, into his ears. Bhaskararaya started to give the names and details of the Yoginis. The ones who were asking the questions were noting it all down, ten days passed in this manner Bhaskararaya was continuing steadily. His enemies accepted his greatness, prostrated before him and begged his forgiveness. This is the story of the mantra.

In another incident, it is said that he went into debt and he chanted the mantra, Om aparṇāyai namaḥ [who owes no debt]
There are two meanings given to the word “Aparna”, when Parvati Devi was performing tapas in Himalayas, as a part of penance she stopped eating for a long time she subsisted on fruits and later only ate leaves and sometime after took only water. So one meaning of the mantra denotes Parvati Devi who did intense penance and did not partake of even leaves. The meaning of “Ṛnam” in Sanskrit is debt. apakatam ṛnam yasyah aparnā. If we worship her, the Devi who will relieve us of our debts, This is another meaning of the mantra “Aparnaye namah.” Bhaskararaya Chanted the mantra “aparṇāyai namaḥ” and was relieved of his debts. There are some of the incidents in the life of Sri Bhaskararaya who has written the commentary for thousand names. Other wonderful stories are also there.

The mantra “ bhakti gamyā, bhakti vaśyā” describes how Devi can be attained through devotion. Devi has a form, this form is for her to bless us. Devi is also nirguna and nirākārā (Beyond qualities and form), she is the divine consciousness that pervades the world.

stree rupam dhyayet devim
pum rupam va vichintayet
athava nishkalam devim
04:44
This says that Devi has no particular form, she pervades the universe. We need not say anything in particular to Amma as she knows everything. She is present within everyone as the divine consciousness. She is constantly with us, She understands without needing to hear anything from us, She is nirvikara (beyond change). The #LalitaSahasranama describes in detail the “nirakara rupam” of devi (beyond form).

nir guṇā - niṣ kalā - śāntā - niṣ kāmā - nir upaplavā - nitya muktā - nir vikārā - niṣ prapañcā - nir āśrayā - nitya śuddhā - nitya buddhā - nir avadyā - nir antarā - niṣ kāraṇā - niṣ kalaṅkā - nir upādhir - nir īśvarā – nīrāgā - rāga mathani - nir madā - mada nāśini - niś cintā - nir ahaṅkārā - nir mohā - moha nāśini

The formless aspect of #Devi is described in the Lalita Sahasrama. Many other mantras in the #Lalita Sahasranama point to the fact that Devi is not confined to her physical form. Her consciousness pervades the entire universe. She takes on attributes to bless her devotees. Her formless self is described in detail in the Lalita Sahasranama. We shall hear more about Devi in the coming days.

Lalita Sahasranama
In the beginning of #Lalita Sahasranama, We have understood that the divine mother has manifested from the fire pit of pure consciousness (cid agni kuṇḍa sambhūtā). We saw the description of peerless beauty in a manner that could be understood and appreciated by everybody. We heard that the divine mother is the queen of the most auspicious city, and sits enthroned on a seat made of the five Brahmas. We heard how She rejoiced at the valour of Her Shaktis who were fiercely destroying the evil forces of Bhandasura. We heard her attribute as Sri Vidya, the well spring of sacred knowledge in the sixteen syllable mantra. We listed the mantras which describes Devi as embodiment of the Mula mantra and one whose subtle body is made up of the three parts of the Panchadashakshari mantra. Then we listened to how Devi can be attained when the heart melts with love for Devi through purity, intensity and innocence of devotion. “bhakti priyā - bhakti gamyā - bhakti vaśyā - bhayāpahā
We realized the greatness of devotion. We listened to her formless attributes, knowing her to be the all-pervading Pure Consciousness. We saw that there is none other than Devi abiding in this universe. There is nothing unattainable for one who praises the glory of Universal Mother. There will be no rebirth for them. They will not have to be reborn in the womb of another mother, they will not have to drink mother’s milk. There is no rebirth for the devotees of Devi.
सरस्वत्या लक्ष्म्या विधि हरि सपत्नो विहरते
रतेः पतिव्रत्यं शिथिलयति रम्येण वपुषा
चिरं जीवन्नेव क्षपित-पशुपाश-व्यतिकरः
परानन्दाभिख्यं रसयति रसं त्वद्भजनवान्
Saundarya Lahari 99

These lines from “Saundarya Lahari,” of Adi Shankaracharya details the results ensuring from singing the glory of the names of Amma. The person becomes attractive to the whole world because he will acquire the beauty of love with grace and munificence of Saraswathi he becomes a profound scholar and Lakshmi #Devi assures prosperity. They become his constant companions. He will never become tainted by lustful emotions and with a pure and tranquil mind, he will live absorbed in the bliss of immortality.

We now come to a very enchanting portion of #LalitaSahasranama
mahā lāvaṇya śevadhi
the treasure house of beauty
mahā pāśupatāstrāgni nirdagdhāsura sainikā
who burned the armies of the demons in the fire of the Mahapashupata missile

mahā gaṇeśa nirbhinna vighna yantra praharṣitā
who rejoices when Ganesha shatters all obstacles

There are so many mantras with mahā as prefix. Let us now look at the portions which has many mantras strung together.
mahārūpā mahāpūjyā mahāpātakanāśinī |
mahāmāyā mahāsattvā mahāśaktirmahāratiḥ ||
mahābhōgā mahaiśvaryā mahāvīryā mahābalā |
mahābuddhirmahāsiddhirmahāyōgēśvarēśvarī ||
mahātantrā mahāmantrā mahāyantrā mahāsanā |
mahāyāgakramārādhyā mahābhairavapūjitā ||
mahēśvaramahākalpamahātāṇḍavasākṣiṇī |
mahākāmēśamahiṣī mahātripurasundarī ||
All these mantras begin with the prefix “mahā”. Devi is also worshipped as mahākailāsanilayā – mahākāmēśanayanakumudāhlādakaumudī
There are many mantras which begin with the prefix “mahā” I will explain the general meaning of these mantras. The word “mahā” means “that which is greatest”. “There is nothing greater than this”, is the meaning of the prefix “mahā”. In Katopanishad and the Bhagavad Gita, the paramatma or the supreme self, is described in this manner.

इन्द्रियेभ्यः परा ह्यर्था अर्थेभ्यश्च परं मनः।
मनसस्तु परा बुद्धिर्बुद्धेरात्मा महान्परः ॥
महतः परमव्यक्तमव्यक्तात्पुरुषः परः।
पुरुषान्न परं किंचित्सा काष्ठा सा परा गतिः ॥
Kathopanishad 1.3.10-11
. The mind is greater than the sense organs, the intelligence is greater than the mind, the great principle (the Maha Tatvam) that underlies the entire universe is greater. Prakriti (Power of Maya) is greater than the Mahat, and Purusha greater than Prakriti. There is nothing greater than Purusha. Purusha is another word for the Paratmatma (the supreme self). It is to Indicate that there is no other greater than Devi,
mahārūpā mahāpūjyā mahāpātakanāśinī |
10:24
mahāmāyā mahāsattvā mahāśaktirmahāratiḥ ||
These lines extolling the greatness of Devi is melodious to the ear. It is rendered in the ashram as a namavali of thousand names of Devi. Her names can be chanted in different melodies by the devotees. It is reminder to us that there is none other greater than Devi. Therefore if we take refuge in her, she will bless us with everything we need. That is the general meaning of these mantras.

The next mantra is Om catuḥ ṣaṣtyupacārāḍhyāyai namaḥ
[who is adored in sixty four ceremonies.]
The word “Upacharam” is Sanskrit. “Upa” the meaning of near. When we go to the temple, we can see the lit lamps and inhale the fragrant incense. Often we do not consider the spiritual principle behind various ceremonies. We perform royal ceremonies that is done for an emperor for Devi also.

Let me narrate an incident from the life of Swami Vivekananda. Once he stayed in the palace of Khetri Maharaj. They discussed many topics. The discussion was on the topic of devotion. Khetri Maharaj said, “Even though worship of God and Sanyas (renunciation) is commendable I have no affinity for worshipping Idols. We worship miniature idols made of copper and gold, we offer flowers and delicious food to the idols. They do not eat the food, I can find no logic or reason behind such ceremonies.” Swami Vivekananda remained silent for the time being. The next day, Swami Vivekananda came to the palace assembly and requested the minister to bring him the picture of the king’s father. He asked the minister to spit at the picture. The minister hesitated, Vivekananda turned to Khetri Maharaj and said, “Why does your minister hesitate to spit at the picture of your father, the former king? Isn’t this as you say, just a drawing on a piece of paper?” The Diwan answered, “This is the father of the king. How can I insult and demean the father of the king who feeds me? I do not consider this a piece of paper; I see the face of my king’s father. He clothes me and gives a home to me and all his subjects?” Swami Vivekananda said “In the same manner we do not see an idol as a statue made of copper or silver or gold. The idol symbolizes and is infused with the all-pervading divine consciousness.” Khetri Maharaj had said that the worship of idols was mere blind belief. After this incident, Vivekananda said to Khetri Maharaj, “In a manner of speaking, all beliefs are blind. We get into a vehicle believing that we will reach our destination. Sometimes accidents do happen but it is our belief that leads us to actual experience.” He said, “विश्वास अँधा है, अनुभव ही सत्य है; Faith is blind. Experience is truth.” Khetri Maharaj appreciated his words.

We must travel to experience through the path of faith. In the same manner, worship of Lord leads us to great experience. When we ceremoniously bathe the tiny idol with milk, ghee and tender coconut water, and offer with great devotion, delicious food to the idol, it is not for the sake of the idol, it is for the purity of our mind, to cleanse the impurities from our own mind. The attitude with which we worship God is crucial. In temples, God is worshipped through five ceremonies, with water, incense, flower, camphor and lit lamps. When we offer deity pure and fresh food prepared in temple itself, it becomes sixth ceremony of worship. When we worship the deity by holding an umbrella and hand held fans over the idol and carrying the deity in circumambulation along the sacred pathway, it is called nine ceremonial methods of worship. We talk about the sixteen ceremonial methods of worship. It can be transformed into sixty-four ceremonial methods of worship. Devi is woken up in the morning, by chanting the Suprabhataam by the help of auspicious instrumental music. It is followed by the ceremonial ablution of the Devi in the temple bathing the ghats, (pond) or bathing her with sacred waters, and sandal wood paste, adorning her with precious ornaments and silk garments. Thus attired, Devi is entertained with song and dance and propitiated with sacred hymns. The four Vedas are chanted in her presence. At night, Devi goes to sleep with a lullaby. The Chathushashti(64) upacharam consists of all the ceremonies from morning to night. Devi is accorded the customary royal honor with gifts and ceremonies usually reserved for Kings.
23:53
In addition to these customs, the attitude with which these offerings are made is most important. Normally we perform only five of these ceremonies. It is due to one’s intense devotions, that more rituals are performed, up to 16 in number. Those who spend extensive time in the ritualistic worship of Devi, extend the ceremony to their heart’s desire. They perform all 64 rituals. They recite stories to Devi, fan her with the Chamaram and hold the royal umbrella to shield her to treat a mother as mother, one need not learn the procedure specifically. There is no need to learn scriptures for that. Love in our hearts for Her is all we need to do what is necessary to propitiate her. In essence, these external ceremonies and rituals only serve to strengthen and nourish the love we have for her in our hearts. Many people say they don’t have the time for ritualistic prayer or Aradhana or they don’t know how to meditate. This mantra helps make up for this lack. With whatever time we have, we may perform five, sixteen or all sixty-four rituals. Amma is always with us. These mantras help us reminiscence about the various activities of Devi.

We are looking at the general meaning of the mantra
Om catuḥ ṣaṣtyupacārāḍhyāyai namaḥ
[who is adored in sixty four ceremonies.] To serve her with love and externalize that love as worship, is what this mantra stands for. As an example of this, we quote the example of the great devotee, Poonthaanam. One day Poonthanam stood before Guruvayoorappan, singing his praises. He sang पद्मनाभो मरप्रभू . We don’t know whether Narayana Bhattathiri heard this himself or was told of this. However, the News reached his ears that Poonthanam had recited the name wrongly. He said “devas and gods have no death. They are without beginning and end”. Thus Bhattathiri criticized Poonthanam. The next day when Bhattathiri went to Guruvayoorappan, he heard a celestial voice, “Poonthanam’s bhakti (devotion) is dearer to me than Bhattathiri’s vibhakti (rhyme & grammar). पद्मनाभो मरप्रभू, means all ‘Ashwatha tree and all others are me, I am this entire world’. This verse of Poonthanam, sung with love, is very dear to me. With honey, milk, water, sandal paste fragrance and flowers, we propitiate God. But the attitude with which we pray to him is more important.

Amma tells us a story of Vidhura’s wife. Shri Krishna visited Vidhura’s house one day. He went there unannounced and without any notice. Everyone thought he would stay in Duryodhana’s house. Vidhura was not prepared for this visit. Lord Krishna thus entered the house where he was not expected. Everyone stood there, astounded. Vidhura was at a loss as to how to receive him. Vidhura’s wife was having a bath at this time. She came running in her bathing clothes and placed an asana for the lord to sit on. It is our custom to feed the guest. So she took some bananas that were there. She peeled it and throwing away the fruit, gave him the peel eagerly. The lord smilingly accepted the offering and ate it graciously. Only when Vidhura stopped her, she realized what she was doing. Shabari, in a similar way, bit the fruit to test its sweetness, before offering it to Lord Rama. While this angered Lakshmana, Lord Rama accepted the offering. It is the love of the devotee for him, that the lord relishes and so these ceremonies are not merely outward rituals, they depict the love for the lord and that is the most important aspect. Mere placement of words on the seven notes do not make a song. It is the emotions that enlivens it. Without bhakti or devotion, the song is lifeless. This is true for any art. Great musicians like Sri Thyagaraja have said "Saṅgīta jñānamu bhakti vinā" - Bereft of devotion, knowledge of music cannot be gained. We must constantly remember God all 24 hours. More beautiful than this, is the method of manasa pooja, advocated by Amma. We must install the deity in our heart. Convert our heart into a temple. Inside the temple of our heart, perform all the ceremonies to Devi. Live in the constant remembrance of Devi. Pray to her constantly.

It is said that the ritual ceremonies are five, six, sixteen, sixty-four and seventy-two in number. Bhaskararaya in his book, has added eight more rituals to sixty-four. They are obeisance to the guru, chanting mantras, worshipping mantras-drishtas or seers, focusing on the meaning of the mantras and so on. Sri Sankaracharya has beautifully encompassed all these into the single hymn. “Chathushashtyupachara Puja”. Apart from describing the sixty-four rituals, he has added eight other rituals in that hymn. This is in essence, what Amma has so beautifully condensed into the Manasa puja. Ritualistic pooja involves ceremonial adornment of the deity in silken garments, drawing of the sacred kalam, (geometrical patterns), fragrant unguents. That is good. However, the important part is our bhakti or devotion. We must perform this pooja in our hearts. Amma says while on a long journey, instead of being idle we must imagine our personal deity in the sky. Keep chanting your mantra constantly. Remembrance of God in the chief task of our lives. Whatever we do in our lives, we must do it while constantly remembering God. That is the meaning of this mantra

We are discussing the meaning of
Om catuḥ ṣaṣtyupacārāḍhyāyai namaḥ
[who is adored in sixty four ceremonies.] The attitude behind the worship is important.

I shall tell you the story of Poosalar Nayanaar, one of the famed Shiva Devotees. He was born in Thirunintravur near Chennai. He was one of the foremost devotees of lord Shiva, the fifty-eighth nayanmar and in all Shiva temples, his idol can be found in the posture with folded palms. A king named Rajendra Pallavan built a temple of granite to Lord Shiva. The temple is known as Kailasanatha Temple. It is even famous today. Rajendra Pallavan employed thousands of artisans over several years to build this temple with the aim of making it a perfect abode for the lord. It was nearing the day of ceremonial inauguration of the temple or “Kumbabishegam”. He had decided on a date of the ceremony. Lord Shiva appeared in king’s dream and said that he had another consecration ceremony on the same day and hence could not be present at the king’s temple. The King thought it was all his imagination and went back to sleep. He got Lord Shiva’s darshan again and again until he realized the truth of his darshan. “Do not perform the consecration on the day that you have decided.” The king thought to himself, let me find out where this temple is. The lord is unable to come for his consecration in the temple that I have built with such love and devotion. The Lord had given the name of Poosalar Nayanar as the devotee.

The king thought that Nayanar’s temple must be bigger and grander than his own. He went to Tiruninravur. Nobody in that village knew the construction of such a temple. All the people that he asked said, “No such temple is being built there”. Finally, when they heard the name ‘Poosalar’, they said he is a Brahmin who lives in a small house in the outskirts of the town.” We shall go and meet him. The king started off to Poosalar Nayanar’s house. Nayanar’s wife came out to meet the king. The King asked him where is Poosalar Nayanar”? “I hear that he is building a grand temple. where is it being built?” The wife said that she knew of no such temple. “My husband has not come out of the house for last couple of years. He has become introverted. I see him crying and at times laughing, often I hear him sing hymns in praise of Lord Shiva. He sits inside his room and eats sparingly. I don’t know where he has built a temple. Please come in and see him”. The king entered the room and saw a man with a long beard and matted hair, sitting with closed eyes in the corner of the room. He was crying and laughing as the king watched him. He shook the Nayanar awake and asked him, Lord Shiva told me that you have built a temple for him”. The lord said that because of the consecration ceremony at your temple, he would not come to the Kailasanatha temple on the same day. Where is this temple that you are building? Tears streamed from the eyes of the Poosalar Nayaanar. He said I am building a temple inside me”. Whenever Nayanar saw a great temple, he would want to build such a temple himself, for the Lord. He started building a temple within his heart. Since then he was planning and imagining in his heart how each aspect of the temple should be constructed, how should be the inauguration ceremony, what all rituals and pujas needs to be performed and all other details he was creating in his mind. Poosalar Nayanar took the hand of the king and placed on his own chest. To his surprise, the king could hear Vedic Chanting, the sounds of the conch, the percussion and other divine music one could hear only in a temple. Later, the king constructed another temple Hridayaleshwar (God of the Heart) Temple for Poosalar Nayanar in Tiunintravur and it even stands today.

Now we are going to discuss the meaning of the mantra
Om catuḥ ṣaṣṭi kalā mayyai namaḥ
[who embodies the sixty four fine arts.]
catuḥ ṣaṣtyupacārāḍhyā - catuḥ ṣaṣṭi kalā mayi - mahā catuḥ ṣaṣṭi koṭi yoginī gaṇa sevitā. These are the three mantras in the Thousand Names of the Devine Mother with the ‘Chatuh Shashti”. The word “Kala” means art. Kala also has other meanings. One meaning of the mantra is ‘She who embodies the sixty-four fine arts. “Kala” denotes the temple art the music and dance performed in the temples. This is the meaning of the word ‘Kala’ 64 forms of arts are mentioned in India. All these 64 forms of arts are considered as secondary knowledge. By itself, none of these are able to lead us to God realisation. These 64 forms include knowledge of 18 languages. The skill to read, write, speak to compose poems in these languages, the knowledge of the four vedas – Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva Vedas. Knowledge of the upa vedas like Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharva veda. The knowledge of wrestling, dancing, stringed musical instruments like Veena, wind instrument like flute. Like this all that benefits us in the worldly life is included in the 64 forms of art. Modern occupations like housekeeping can also be included in this. But by practicing this alone, we won’t be able to attain our goal of life.

To spend our lives performing these arts is not the ultimate goal of our life. Human life is not for that. When we become aware that these are the manifestations of the splendour of God, that these arts are forms of worship to God. Then only we will be able to attain God realization. There is a story that illustrates how art is practiced as a form of worship. This happened in the life of a King Chempakasseri in Kerala. Once this King had a discussion with a person who narrates stories of Gods and Goddesses in temples (Chakyaar). The King asked the person how long will he be able to go on, narrating the stories. He said he will be able to go on telling the story till there is oil and wick in the lamp before him. The King took it as a challenge and made arrangements to provide Oil and wick and whatever else is necessary. The person started to narrate Ramayana- the story of Shri Rama. In the meantime, the King went for a pilgrimage to Kashi. He returned after the darshan of Lord Vishwanatha. The King had totally forgotten about the challenge. After many days when he went near the temple, he heard a loud noise of cheers. He enquired the reason for the cheers. Somebody told him that a person is narrating the story of Lord Rama for the past few years. That day he was narrating the birth of Rama and people are cheering in happiness. When the King heard this he remembered the arrangements made for the person to tell stories. In the same way, when we perform an art, we are glorifying the splendour of God as if we are offering a prayer in our alter. Whether it is music or dance or any other temple art. That is a form of worship. The purpose of performing any art is to utilise the God given talent to worship him. Thyagaraja Bhagavatar, Mutuswami Deekshithar, Shyama Sastri and many others who have practiced different forms of art are persons who attained God realization. “catuḥ ṣaṣṭi kalā mayi” means that all knowledge that we have acquired, all the talent we got, Knowledge in the languages, ability to interpret things, knowledge of Vedas, Upavedas all these are embodiments of God. The meaning of this mantra is – All Knowledge is the glory of The Divine Mother.

We are discussing the meaning of the mantra,
catuḥ ṣaṣṭi kalā mayi
[who embodies the sixty four fine arts.]
Some interpret the word kala as Tantra. There are several medical knowledge systems like Salya Tantra, Salakya Tantra etc. The word Tantra is also used to denote spiritual traditions. It is said that Lord Shiva has taught ‘Tantra to the Divine Mother Parvati. Bhaskara Rayar has explained sixty-four types of Tantras in his book. Tantra cannot give liberation on its own. For example if you learn and practice music, you may not get liberation. Only if you practice it with an attitude of worship you get moksha. That is why Adi Shankaracharya is giving instruction as to how these tantras are to be practiced.

चतुः-षष्टया तन्त्रैः सकल मतिसन्धाय भुवनं
स्थितस्तत्त्त-सिद्धि प्रसव परतन्त्रैः पशुपतिः |
पुनस्त्व-न्निर्बन्धादखिल-पुरुषार्थैक घटना-
स्वतन्त्रं ते तन्त्रं क्षितितल मवातीतर-दिदम् ‖
Soundarya Lahari 31
“Pashupati at first remained satisfied after giving to the world, the sixty-four tantras which expound practices conferring only one or another of the various psychic powers and worldly fulfilments. Afterwards, on Thy special insistence, He revealed this Thy own tantra to the world, independent of all the others and capable of conferring all the four aspirations of men-dharma, artha, kaama and moksha.”

Pashu means living beings, Pashupati is one who protects all living beings. It is said that Pashupati (Lord Shiva) formulated sixty-four tantras. But people did not get the result they expected by practicing these tantras. They could not attain liberation.

punastva-nnirbandhād akhila-puruśhārthaika ghaṭanā svatantraṃ
So the Divine Mother, with her immense love for her children insisted her consort Lord Pashupathi that he should formulate tantra which has the quality of devotion. Thus the lord formulated the tantra called Svatantra Tantra or Sri Vidya to worship the Divine Mother. Everybody was delighted with that. By practicing this, ordinary people become good spiritual seekers. Average seekers become ideal seekers. Ideal seekers attained liberation. Good people evolved to excellent people. It is said in the ‘Saundarya Lahari’ that Lord Pashupathi had formulated the method that is suitable for all types of seekers for worshipping the Divine Mother.

We are discussing the general meaning of the mantras,
catuḥ ṣaṣtyupacārāḍhyā
catuḥ ṣaṣṭi kalā mayi
mahā catuḥ ṣaṣṭi koṭi yoginī gaṇa sevitā
[who is attended by six hundred forty million yoginis.]

We already discussed a story about this that happened in the life of Bhaskararaya.

The next mantras are
Om manu vidyāyai namaḥ
[who is the embodiment of Manuvidya.]
Om candra vidyāyai namaḥ
[who is the embodiment of Candravidya.]
Om candra maṇḍala madhyagāyai namaḥ
[who resides in the center of candramandala, the moon’s disc.]
11:27
There are twelve main devotees of the Divine Mother. Their names are Manu, Chandra, Kubera, Lopamudra, Agasthya, Manmatha, Agni, Surya, Indra, Skanda, Shiva and Durvasa. We always say that we are very busy. We don’t have time for prayer. ‘Did you chant the Thousand Names of the Divine mother today?’ “No, no I just chanted the 108 names, I was on tour, I was busy in the office”. We will say some excuses like this. But it is not difficult to do Hundred tasks to do one more. Out of 24 hours it takes only half an hour to chant the thousand names. If anybody says that he cannot spare even that much time, is not being reasonable. Let us see the names of twelve devotees. Manu, Chandra, Kubera, Lopamudra, Lord Shiva himself, Skanda, Durvasa, Manmata. They all do the greatest tasks in the world. Manu is the son of Lord Brahma. He is considered as the head of this Manvanthara. There is also a king in the same name who has written Manusmriti. Kubera the lord of wealth is also a devotee of the Di vine Mother. Lord Brahma, Lord Parameshvara (Shiva). While mentioning the unique benefits of the worship, it is observed that these devotees are immersed in the meditation of the Divine Mother chanting the 1000 names 24 hours a day. These noble beings who perform the greatest tasks in the universe are performing this worship and are benefited. Then why can’t we chant this sacred prayer? It is a lame excuse that we don’t have time.

Manmatha is the seer of a mantra of Sri Vidya. There is a form of practice formulated by him. All these have formulated forms of practice for the worship of the Divine Mother. People practiced these forms an enjoyed the benefits. We are discussing the mantras, “manu vidyā”, “candra vidyā”. In our scriptures all the Divine names are not called mantras. Single words are called beejam (seed). We call them ‘seed mantras’. When deities in the male form are indicated it is called mantras. When the word in the mantra is more than 24 letters it is called ‘mantra mala (the chain of mantras)’. Sri Lalita Sahasranama is a unique composition. Some mantras from this Sahasranama is used for initiation. Mantras like ‘Om Hrim Mahadevyai Namah’, ‘Om Parashakthyai Namah’ are inscribed in temples. These mantras are used by the spiritual masters for initiating their disciples. Thus Lalita Sahasranama is a chain of mantras. We usually make garlands with flowers or gold or diamonds. Only Rich people will be able to do that. Common people decorate the Divine Mother with this garland of mantras. When we chant the Sahasranama it becomes a garland of mantras. When the deities are in the female form, the worship is called Vidya. Adding the prefix ‘Sri’, this message is called Sri Vidya. As mentioned earlier The Divine Mother has twelve main devotees: Manu, Chandra, Kubera, Lopamudra, Agasthya, Manmatha, Agni, Surya, Indra, Skanda, Shiva and Durvasa. These exalted beings have visualised the mantras in their hearts. It is not right to say that they have composed the mantras, these mantras are visualised by them. The form of worship formulated by them is Vidya. Here two examples are given, Manu Vidya, Chandra Vidya. Depending upon the qualities of the seeker one can even attain liberation by practicing this form of worship. Ordinary seeker will become better seekers, Average seekers become ideal and ideal seeker will evolve to still greater heights. We will discuss the principles and greatness of the Divine Mother further in the coming days.

The next important topic in Lalita Sahasranama is the form of the goddess composed of five brahmas. There are two mantras –
pañca pretāsanāsīnā
[who sits on the seat formed by five corpses.]
pañca brahma svarūpiṇi
[whose form is composed of the five Brahmas.]
pañca yajña priyā
[who is fond of the five forms of sacrifices]
pañca preta mañcādhi śāyini
[who reclines on a couch made of the Five Corpses]
pañcami
[who is the fifth]
pañca bhūteśi
[who is the Goddess of the five elements]
pañca saṅkhyopacāriṇi
[who is worshipped using five objects of worship]
pañca kṛtya parāyaṇā
[who is devoted to the five functions (mentioned in the mantras above).]


There are several mantras indicating the five organs of actions and the entire cosmos consisting of the five elements.
शिवः शक्त्या युक्तो यदि भवति शक्तः प्रभवितुं
न चेदेवं देवो न खलु कुशलः स्पन्दितुमपि।
In the first stanza of Soundarya Lahari it is mentioned that Shiva cannot even move without Shakti, the Divine Mother. Goddess is also devoted to the five functions – Creation, Preservation, Annihilation, Blessing & Disappearance. These five functions are carried out by Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Ishana and Sadashiva. The divine mother is glorified as “pañcami- pañca bhūteśi
- pañca saṅkhyopacāriṇi”. The Divine Mother is ‘pañca yajña priyā’ – fond of five forms of sacrifices. Thus, as Shankararachrya has said in the hymn Saundarya Lahari, without the blessing of the Divine Mother even Shiva will not be able to move. śivaḥ śaktyā yukto yadi bhavati śaktaḥ prabhavituṃ
na chedevaṃ devo na khalu kuśalaḥ spanditumapi|

We are going to discuss another important area of Shri Lalita Sahasranama. We usually notice only gross things. In Katopanishad it is said ‘paranchikani vyatrinat swayambhu, thasmat paranpashyati antaratman’, the attention of almost every one of us is directed outside. We are not very much interested in paying attention to our self. We never try to understand the principles of this universe. We are going to discuss the part where the principles of the universe are mentioned. There are three mantras,
kṣetra svarūpā
[whose body is matter.]
kṣetreśi
[who is the wife of Shiva.]
kṣetra kṣetrajña pālini
[who is the protector and knower of matter, thus the protector of body and soul.]

The commentary of the mantras can be compared to the commentary of the chapter ‘Kshetra, Kshetrajna Yoga’ in Bhagavad Gita. The Divine Mother is Kshetraswarupa, whose body is matter. The Divine Mother is also Kshetreshi, the ruler of the matter, the body of all beings. She is Kshetra Kshetrajnapalini – protector of body and soul. This is the general meaning of the mantras. There are several meanings of the word, ‘Kshetra’ the most common meaning is ‘temple’. In Bhagavad Gita Lord Krishna says
इदं शरीरं कौन्तेय क्षेत्रमित्यभिधीयते |
एतद्यो वेत्ति तं प्राहु: क्षेत्रज्ञ इति तद्विद: ||
This body is termed as kṣhetra (the field of activities), and the one who knows this body is called kṣhetrajña (the knower of the field) by the sages who discern the truth about both.
Gita 13.2

Like I said earlier, because our attention is always to the outside, we do not notice many things. If we ask a child what is greater 8 or 9? The child will easily answer it is 9. But if we ask about greater numbers the child may get confused. Like that we do not give attention to the subtle things. Till now we were discussing about form, bhakti, upasana, mantras and other modes of worships. We might be able to get concentration if we have devotion or perform worship or chant mantra. Chanting the thousand names lead us to the principle of deity with a form.
14:31
The most common meaning of Kshetram is temple, another meaning is ‘field’. In Bhagavad Gita the lord says that this body is Kshetram. When we say temple we think of the temples in Kashi, Kanchi, Rameshwaram etc. The spiritual energy of these temples is immense because of the greatness of those who have consecrated the temple, the systematic worship that is performed there, the power of the devotion and the spiritual practices of the devotees. In general, we can say that the goddess in such temple is ‘Kshetreshi’. It can also be said that this body is ‘kshetram’ and the individual soul that is present in this is ‘kshetrajna’ (in-dweller). Our goal in life is to know the ‘kshetrajna’ (in-dweller). Our goal in life is to know the God that dwells in our heart and the all-pervading God is the same. ‘Field’ is another meaning of the word ‘kshetram’. A farmer is toiling in the field; it will be fruitful only if what he is doing is systemic. First he has to plough, weed, then add manure, water sow the seeds, put a fence to protect the sapling etc. If taken care he will get the yield when time comes. But if the order is broken he will get nothing. If at first he sows the seed and then plough, then add water and manure and then plough again he will get only weeds as yield. Proper order should always be there. Worship of god is a science; we have to practice it in the right way. It will not be fruitful if we do it in the way we like.

The lord says in Bhagavad Gita
नेहाभिक्रमनाशोऽस्ति प्रत्यवायो न विद्यते |
स्वल्पमप्यस्य धर्मस्य त्रायते महतो भयात् || 
Working in this state of consciousness, there is no loss or adverse result, and even a little effort saves one from great danger.
Gita 2.40

Spiritual practices like chanting of mantra repeating the divine names, remembrance of God, listening to scriptures, meeting God realized persons, keeping the company of devotees and ideal people – very little of these is enough.

भगवद्गीता किञ्चिदधीता
गङ्गाजललवकणिका पीता ।
One who has studied the Bhagavad Gita just a little, drunk even a drop of Ganga water is enough
Bhaja Govindam 20

A Drop of the water of Ganga is enough. Even if this is very little, it will save us from great fear. It transforms us. It even grants us liberation. The Divine Mother is Kshetraswarupini – That which is present in the great temples, in our mind and hearts is Divine Mother herself. She is Kshetreshi (the body of all beings) and kshetra kshetrajna palini (protector of the body and soul). There is nothing other than the Devine Mother in the whole universe. That which is present in the great temples, in our mind and hearts and that which pervades the whole universe is Devine Mother herself. We will discuss the principles and greatness of the Devine Mother further in the coming days.

In Bhagavad Gita the lord explains the word Kshetram thus
महाभूतान्यङ्ककारो बुद्धिरव्यक्त मेव च |
इन्द्रियाणि दशैकं च पञ्च चेन्द्रियगोचरा: ||
The field of activities is composed of the five great elements, the ego, the intellect, the unmanifest primordial matter, the eleven senses (five knowledge senses, five working senses, and mind), and the five objects of the senses.
Gita 13.6

इच्छा द्वेष: सुखं दु:खं सङ्घातश्चेतना धृति: |
एतत्क्षेत्रं समासेन सविकारमुदाहृतम् ||
Desire and aversion, happiness and misery, the body, consciousness, and the will—all these comprise the field and its modifications.
Gita 13.7


The great elements: egoism, intellect and also unmanifested nature, the ten senses and the mind and five objects of the senses. Desire, hatred, pleasure, pain – altogether there are 24 tattavas are called ‘Kshetra’. God is the in–dwelling consciousness. Bhagavad Gita interprets ‘Kshetra’ and ‘Kshetrajna’ like this. This is how Kshetra and Kshetrajna is presented in Bhagavad Gita. When we understand that our body is the residence of God, when we understand that the goal of our life is to know the in–dweller, then we will never misuse this body, we will never commit mistakes and the immoral actions that we do knowingly or will never drink alcohol. We will use our body, mind and senses in the right manner. We will go to temples, meet spiritual masters, listen and live according to their teachings, listen to scripture, use your limbs to prostrate and do service to the spiritual masters. Like this we use our body in the proper way. By doing this we will achieve our goal of God realization. The whole matter in the universe is Divine Mother. She is the ruler of all matter. We observed that She is the divine presence in each being.

The next mantra is
kṣaya vṛddhi vinirmuktā
[who is free from growth and decay.]


The general meaning of this mantra is “The Divine Mother is free from growth and decay”. We take notice of two things in this universe. That which is potent and that which is inert. This is briefly explained in Lalita Sahasranama as

cicchakti - cetanā rūpā - jaḍa śakti - jaḍātmikā


Everything that has pure consciousness is Divine Mother. Everything that is inanimate is also the Divine Mother. Divine Mother is the object of cause and object of effect. She is both the inherent cause and the instrumental cause. To understand better, I will discuss it briefly. A pot is made up of mud. Pot is the effect and mud is the cause. We see ornaments. Ornaments are the effect and gold is the cause. Mud, gold all these are objects of cause. Suppose we made a Cloth. Cloth is the effect and thread is the cause. Now we understand that mud, gold, thread – all these are objects of cause and pot, ornaments and cloth are objects of effect. Divine mother is the object of cause and the object of effect. She is both the creator and the creation. Amma says that this is not two. This is the cause for dispute among all the religions. Nobody is bothered about the inert objects. All potent objects are one, they are not two. Shankaracharya also said the same thing. But he did not say one, he used the word – “Advaita (non-duality)”, that is ‘not two’. What we see in the outer world, river, mountain, men and other living beings all these we consider separate, with different names and forms. But he made it clear that the living force, the consciousness, the individual soul and the supreme self that is present in all these is one. At the same time people like Madhvacharya argued that this can never be one. They proposed that God and the living beings are different.
23:20
We usually see the universe in three forms. In the projected world everything is different, the names and the forms are different. We call them accordingly. The world that we know through our senses can be compared to seeing objects in dim light. When we see a rope in dim light we may mistake it for a snake. In light we will not have any doubt, we understand it as a rope. In darkness (of ignorance) there is nothing to be mistaken. Because we do not see anything, confusion happens only in between. When we look at the world, we feel that everything is different this is unreal. But in truth, for God Realized persons, and for us also, when we have the eye of wisdom, we will understand that in reality everything is one. This is the principle that Shankaracharya has established. At the same time masters like Madhvacharya had another opinion. Suppose we have an unbroken coconut. We call it coconut. But when we remove the fibre and seed is separated, now the seed is called coconut. When the shell of the seed is broken, the water inside is separated. Now we have coconut water and coconut is still there, next we scrap the meat out, now there is shell and still there is coconut. Madhvacharya wanted to establish that in the projected world the names and forms are different. Once when he was asked about this he asked for some water somebody brought water. He took it in a spoon it had as much water as it can take. Next he took it in a vessel. He could fill it with as much water as it can take. If you take in a pot you can take it to the fill. A pond can hold as much as its size. In a river there will be much more. Thus it should be determined according to the size of the vessel. He propagated his theory that as long as one cannot see it as one, better see it as two.

Now the mantra, “kṣaya vṛddhi vinirmuktā” the meaning of the mantra is ‘She who is free from growth and decay’. We usually talk of the six forms of changes- birth, existence, growth, transformation, decay and death. This happens to everybody. The Divine mother does not have these six forms of changes. Because there is no other matter in this universe (than the Divine Mother). There is nothing apart from the Divine Mother. So the Divine Mother does not have the state of growth and decay. Consciousness and lifeless, both are Divine Mother. So she has no growth or decay. The next few mantras illustrate this principle of Self. We will discuss the principles and the glory of the Divine Mother in the coming days.

Lalita Sahasranama
https://youtu.be/_ruu0UVshfk
12:45
We are now looking at the important spiritual principles or truths embodied in the Lalita Sahasranama. Devi is “kṣetra svarūpā, kṣetreśi, kṣetra kṣetrajña pālini, and kṣaya vṛddhi vinirmuktā, One who is free from growth and decay. We have seen that “Kshetram” has many meanings, as the manifest universe, as the great temples and also as our body. The Vedas speak about this principle or truth of the indestructible, all pervasive self. The Puranas, also called the Upapramanas are written for those who are not able to directly experience this truth. The Puranas also convey the same truths. The Puranas make it clear to us, the concepts that we find indecipherable in the Vedas. Veda says “satyam vada” and this is depicted through the example of the story of the King Harishchandra in Puranas. The highest state of spirituality is propounded in the Vedas and it is the same absolute reality that is described in the Lalita Sahasranama.
Kalidasa has written the following verse.
किं न सिद्ध्येद्वपुः श्यामलं कोमलं चन्द्रचूडान्वितं तावकं ध्यायतः
तस्य लीलासरोवारिधिः तस्य केलीवनं नन्दनं, तस्य भद्रासनं भूतलं,
तस्य वाग्देवता किङ्करी, तस्य चाज्ञाकरी श्री स्वयम्
What is not accessible or achievable to the devotee who meditates on your beautiful dark blue form sporting the crescent moon on the head? For him the ocean is the pool for water sports, the Nandana vana is the forest where he can play, his seat is the entire earth, the Goddess of speech is his handmaid and Goddess Lakshmi waits for his orders. 
Shyamala Dandakam

For those who meditate upon the form of Lalita Parameshwari in her bewitching beauty, all sidhis are within their reach. The universe can be owned by him. The three worlds become his own. (Heaven, Earth, Hell) Goddess Sarasvati will be present in his words, his words will have beauty and wisdom. He will be served by Mahalakshmi. He will become prosperous in life. In Lalita Sahasranama Devi is praised as
kaṭākṣa kiṅkarī bhūta kamalā koṭi sevitā
[who is attended by millions of Lakshmis who are subdued by Her mere glances]
Lalitambika is adored by different names, “Lalita, Lalitamba, Para-Hanta-Swaroopini, Para Bhattarika, Chidroopini”. All her names are different ways of describing the absolute reality. The Universe is suffused with Devi.
Now we are entering the domain of the subtle from the gross. The next part of the mantras that we are going to take up are
Om viśva rūpāyai namaḥ
[who has the whole universe as Her form.]
Om jāgariṇyai namaḥ
[who assumes the form of the jiva who is in the waking state.]
Om svapantyai namaḥ
[who assumes the form of the jiva in the dream state.]
Om taijasātmikāyai namaḥ
[who is the soul of the jiva in the dream state.]
Om suptāyai namaḥ
[who assumes the form of the jiva experiencing deep sleep.]
Om prājñātmikāyai namaḥ
[who is not separate from the jiva in the state of deep sleep.]
Om turyāyai namaḥ
[who is in the state of turya.]
Om sarvāvasthā vivarjitāyai namaḥ
[who transcends all states.]
12:45
The different states of consciousness are described here. Devi is of the form of the universe. She is of the form of the universe in the waking state. She is called “Thaijasa” in the dream state. In the state of Sushupthi or deep sleep, Devi is called “Prajnan”. Devi is also the fourth state of “Turiya” She is also beyond all four states called “turyatheetham”. This is the general meaning of the above mantras. “Jagarini” is the state in which our mind and sense organs are awake and alert in its interaction with the world. In the Vedas, this state is called “Vishwan”. “Swapanthi” – Only the mind remains active, the sense organs are inactive, the body lies asleep, still as a corpse. This is the state when dreams occur. Even though we dream of all the multifarious objects and activities of the world, they are purely creations of the mind. This state is called “Thaijasan” We go into deep sleep. There are three factors here. The feeling that I slept well along with the perception of “I” that is accompanied by the ignorance and unawareness. We experience happiness in deep sleep, we say that “I slept well”, but this state is not a means for attaining jnana or enlightenment. If it was so, all of us would have attained enlightenment through deep sleep. It is not possible. It is called “Prajnan” . “Viswan, Thaijasan and Prajnan” these three names denote the waking, dream and deep sleep states in the Lalita Sahasranama. Ideal saadhaks (spiritual aspirant) go beyond these three states to reach the fourth state of “Turiyam” or the highest state of spiritual enlightenment. They experience the fourth state of “Turiyam”. “Turiyam” is not tainted with the ignorance and unawareness present in the other three states of Jagrath. They have become enlightened. This is called “Turiyam”. There is another state beyond these four states, it cannot be described by mere words. It is called “Turiyatheetham”. Those who have attained this state, even though they resemble ordinary human beings their words, actions, movements, breath and thought come from a realm that cannot be described in words or grasped by the intelligence. It is with constant establishment in the state of “Turiyam” that man can go beyond it and attain the Absolute reality. It cannot be called a state of consciousness. It transcends all states. It is the goal of every human life, the attainment of oneness with the pure self. It is the bliss continuously experienced by those who have been liberated from the cycle of birth and death, while still in their human bodies. This cannot be defined as a state, hence in Lalita Sahasranama Devi is called, “sarvāvasthā vivarjitā” - One who transcends all states. “viśva rūpā - jāgariṇi ” – The one who is called Vishwan in the. “svapanti- taijasātmikā” – The one who is called Thaijasan in the state of dream sleep. “suptā - prājñātmikā ” – The one who is called “Prajnan” in the state of deep sleep. “turyā and turyātitā”, - the fourth state and one who transcends all states, are all the different aspects of Devi.

Lalita Sahasranama

We do not usually ponder upon the waking, dream and deep sleep states. For people who study Vedanta, this knowledge is very important. The pure self stands as a witness to these states. The Pure Self is the witness to the Jagrat, Swapna and Sushupti states. This is very crucial.

Let me talk about an experience of mine. It concerns a dream. I would like to share it with you because it reveals a glimpse of the greatness of Amma. This incident happened around twenty-five years ago. I was a student in the Ayurveda College at Trivandrum. Travel between Vallikavu and Trivandrum was very easy. So I would come to almost every Devi Bhava of Amma. I would also entertain myself by going to cinemas. I would accompany my friends to the cinema even though I wished to stop the practice. Finally, one day I made a resolve to stop going to the movies. But after few days, I gave into the coercion of my friends and went for a movie. My conscience pricked me, that I could not desist from this practice, even after meeting Amma. Darshan was given at the hut, in those days. I came to Amma and confessed, “I keep frequenting movie theatres”. Never before had I told about Amma my name or what it was that I was doing. I would come to her, take her darshan and go back. That was my routine. I had never before even spoken to Amma. Amma had never before tried to hold a conversation with me. But on that particular day, strangely with great anger, she enquired of me the localities and theatres I went to and movies I watched. She told the assembled devotees, ‘the government is to blame for letting these young kids run wild”. They become trapped in their bad habits “This will become very detrimental for their future”. “The government should put an end to this” By then, I had become familiar with almost all the devotees who come down from Trivandrum for Amma’s darshan, and I was known to many of the ashram residents also. All of them were sitting around Amma. I felt very upset, it seemed that Amma had defamed my character in front of all my acquaintances. I returned to Trivandrum. For a long time after that, I wouldn’t go for Amma’s darshan. I would frequent the ashram, talk to residents, listen to the bhajans and go back. Six months passed in this manner. I had not gone for darshan all these months and in the final darshan Amma had spoken very harshly to me. I was under the impression that she had abandoned me. At that time, I was not aware that Amma’s anger was a mask she puts on to bring the seeker to the right path. I was not aware of her impartial nature.
11:14
The thought started troubling my mind, “May be I should go in search of another ashram as Amma seems to be totally neglecting me”. But in between these months, a very strange thing had happened to me. Whenever I slept Amma would be there in my dreams. She would sometimes scold me, talk to me, show affection towards me. But Amma was unfailingly there for me in my dreams. Whether I slept in the morning or night, I would always wake up dreaming about her. This has been recurring for last six months. I mustered up my courage on Krishna Jayanthi, and went for darshan during Devi Bhava. I thought I would unburden myself to her, “Am I suitable, good enough to visit the ashram? Should I go elsewhere if Amma finds me unfit to receive her darshan”? I went and managed to say something or the other to her. Amma listened to me with great patience and explained to me “Is it possible to build a hospital and put up a notice saying that the sick cannot enter here? Can you learn to swim laying on the ground? Can I start a school and say that no students will be given admission? Purity of mind should be gained through devotion, by frequently coming to the ashram. Amma has established the ashram for this purpose. It is for everybody. Do not think that you are unsuitable for the ashram”. With patience and love Amma cleared the doubts in my mind. I felt that Amma had no genuine anger towards me, it was a mask she put on to lead me back to the right path. I started going for her Darshan. But the strange thing was that, after I started receiving her physical darshan, she no longer came to my dream state. I realized that our dreams are also under her control. If Amma decides, she can also bless through dreams.

In Lalita Ashtothara, there is a mantra
om jagrat-swapna-sushuptinaam-sakshi-bhutyai-namo-namah
Devi is the witness to the three states of waking, dream and deep sleep.
Devi is the knower in the three states. Each and every thought of ours pass through her, whether in the dream or in the waking state. This is the knowledge that I gained through my personal experience.
viśva rūpā - jāgariṇi - svapanti – taijasātmikā – suptā – prājñātmikā – turyā - sarvāvasthā vivarjitā

These mantras teach us that Devi is present not only in the physical objects that make up the Universe, but also in the different states.

Lalita Sahasranama

Our next mantra in Lalita Sahasranama is
unmeṣa nimiṣotpanna vipanna bhuvanāvali
[who causes a series of worlds to arise and disappear with the opening and closing of Her eyes.]
The universe is created and destroyed by Devi. The simple explanation would be that when Devi opens her eyes, universe is created and when She closes Her eyes the world dissolves. In Vedanta it is called “Shrishti Drishti Vaadam”. The universe is within us. When there is no such cognition, the universe does not exist. It is very subtle principle expounded in Vedanta that the universe exists only when we believe in it’s existence. It is not suitable, when it is connected to individuals. But when it is connected to Devi, it is perfectly correct. When she closes her eyes, the universe dissolves, when she opens her eyes, the universe is created. Devi never close her eyes, fearing that, if she does so, the universe will be swallowed by flood waters. She is ever compassionate. “calan mīnābha locanā”- like fish that never close their eyes even while asleep. She can also be adored as one who never sleeps, who is eternally vigilant, like the fish.

Sri Shankaracharya has interpreted thus in the following verse.
निमेषोन्मेषाभ्यां प्रलयमुदयं याति जगति
तवेत्याहुः सन्तो धरणिधरराजन्यतनये
त्वदुन्मेषाज्जातं जगदिदमशेषं प्रलयतः
परेत्रातुं शङ्के परिहृतनिमेषास्तव दृशः
Oh! daughter of the king of mountains, the learned sages say that  this world has its genesis and dissolution with the opening and closing of your eyes. I believe that your eyes do not even wink for a moment,  so that this world created by the opening of your eyes,  does not ever get destroyed in the deluge.
Soundarya Lahari 55

This verse has the same meaning. If Devi close her eyes the universe will be destroyed in a deluge, if Devi opens her eyes, the universe will be created. These are the words spoken by the noble people. “O! Daughter of Himavan, (Parvathi) you shine effulgent, tender hearted, without even momentarily closing your eyes. Your glory embraces this world, intent on saving all its beings”. This is the easiest interpretation for the above verse.
unmeṣa nimiṣotpanna vipanna bhuvanāvali
She who creates and destroys worlds when she opens and closes her eyes. Her tender heart intent on protecting and saving all her children. We describe many forms of the Devi as an example of this attribute of Hers. In Thiruvarur (Tamil Nadu), Devi is seated on the “Kutikaasanam”. It is a very difficult posture, with one leg crossed over the other. This posture is explained as the posture in which Devi undertakes spiritual penance for the wellbeing of the world. There is a place called “Maangad” near Chennai. There Devi stands on the toe of one foot, with the other leg tucked on to her waist. She is surrounded by Panchagni (the five fires). Both arms of Devi are upraised. Standing one the toe of one foot, with the other folded up to her waist, surrounded by the five fires, with arms appraised in prostration, the form of the Devi is one practising severe spiritual austerity and meditation. It is believed that Devi is practicing these sever penance for the welfare of the world. Devi is constantly endeavouring to save and uplift her children from the tāpatrayas (ādhyātmika, ādhibhautika & ādhidaivika)
of misery and pain existing in this world. She is constantly practicing sever penance for uplifting her children.
23:25
Our Amma also sits for darshan, twenty-four hours of the day, with a smiling countenance. Each one of us approaches Her with a different sorrow, with different stories of distress. But even after a person comes to her again after 30 years, Amma recognizes him instantly. She understands their pain. Often, when people approach her, they lose themselves in the effulgence of Her presence and cannot express their sorrow to Her. Many foreigners who go for Darshan are not from the English speaking world, it is not possible for us to translate their words to Amma. But Amma understands each emotion and thought that passes through them, and after darshan, they go back content and comforted, surrendering their burdens at Her feet. She sits happily for many hours, patient and vigorous, without any sign of exhaustion, waiting to receive them. In fact, Amma becomes upset if they do not go for Her darshan. Amma is more upset on the days when there is no Darshan. It is due to compassion that the divine Mother sits without closing Her eyes, glancing at Her beloved children and with Her Sankalpa (intention that harness the will) showering Her grace upon them. She opens Her eyes and dissolves the Universe when She closes them.

The mantras in the Lalita Sahasranama that we will be seeing today, describing the Devi are
Om sahasra śīrṣa vadanāyai namaḥ [who has a thousand heads and faces.]
Om sahasrākṣyai namaḥ
[who has a thousand eyes.]
Om sahasra pade namaḥ
[who has a thousand feet.]

In Purusha Suktham, Vishnu is praised with the same attributes.
सहस्रशीर्षा पुरुषः सहस्राक्षः सहस्रपात् ।
स भूमिं विश्वतो वृत्वात्यतिष्ठद्दशाङुलम् ॥
पुरुष एवेदं सर्वं यद्भूतं यच्च भव्यम् । उतामृतत्वस्येशानो यदन्नेनातिरोहति ॥
Purusha Suktam 1-2

The Lord has a thousand heads. All the eyes in the universe belong to him. Sahasram need not mean exact thousand. Even in some Sahasranamas, where the thousand attributes of the deity are described we can see there might be more or less than a thousand mantras. The Lalita Sahasranama contains exactly thousand mantras. ‘All the feet in the universe belong to him’. ‘Maha Vishnu pervades the entire universe’. ‘He is beyond this universe’. ‘The Purusha (the Cosmic self, the Universal Principle) permeating this universe, is Maha Vishnu’. ‘God pervades and permeates this universe’. ‘God is the Absolute Reality that is beyond this Universe’. ‘These are among the various meanings of this mantra’. A ‘thousand’ denotes the infinite nature of the lord. It does not mean just one thousand. It means that the earth is filled with, replete with the presence of God. God is both the cause and the effect. Let us take three examples to illustrate this point. Let us take the examples of a pot, an ornament and a piece of cloth. A pot is the creation, the reason for its existence is the mud that created it. If all gold ornaments are creations, the cause is the gold. Thread is the cause behind all cloth in this world. The tenet states that there is no distinction between the cause and the effect. Therefore, we cannot say that God is separate from the universe that is His creation. We cannot say that God sits somewhere in heavens protecting the good and punishing the wicked. We cannot say that the good attain salvation and the wicked fall into hell. This universe has been created for its inhabitants to experience the effects of their past karma. One of the attributes of God is that he created and pervades this universe in which the fruits of past Karma are correctly experienced. This is the glory of god the mantras used to describe Vishnu in Purusha Suktham, sahasra śīrṣa vadanā - sahasrākṣi - sahasra padā are also attributes of the Devi praised in the Lalita Sahasranama.

The next mantra that we are going to explain in the Lalita Sahasranama are
Om ābrahma kīṭa jananyai namaḥ
[who is the mother of everything from Brahma to the lowliest insect.]
Om varṇāśrama vidhāyinyai namaḥ
[who established the order of the social division in life.]
We have heard that the universe and all of the creation is imbued by Devi. Depending on the fruits of their Karma, souls take birth in different forms. Through the experience and actions of this life, led in accordance with the cosmic law upholding true values, they are able to achieve the purity of mind necessary for liberation. ābrahma kīṭa janani - She brings alive all creatures, from Brahma to the most insignificant insect. “Janani” or mother, emphasizes once more the motherly nature of Devi. Many mantras in the Lalita Sahasranama glorify Devi as mother “Mata, Ambika, Ayi, Jagadhatri, Jagajanani, prasu, viyadadijagatprasu”. These mantras use the Sanskrit terms for Mother to praise Devi. It is Devi who is the mother to all the creation, from Brahma to the lowliest insect. In Ayurveda the two smallest forms of life, are called Kakerukam and Akerukam. They seem to be even smaller than the atom. In Bhaskararaya’s book it is mentioned that Devi is the creator of creatures ranging from microbial beings like Kakerukam and Akerukam to Brahma, who is the creator of this universe. “Janani” – the one who has given birth to. This is the word used in the mantra “ābrahma kīṭa janani”.

Devi did not give birth and then neglect the creation She is also “varṇāśrama vidhāyini” Brahmins (Priests, Teachers) Kshatriyas, (warriors, administrators) Vaishyas, (agriculturists and merchants) and Shudras (service providers and laborers). Ashramas were also classified into four. The four age based life stages are Brahmacharya (Students), Grihastha (Householder) Vanaprastha (retired) Sanyasa (renunciate) Then we have the Athivarna (Who are beyond the four Varnas). Avadhutas (Mystic, sometimes considered to be mad monks) are beyond the boundaries of the four varnas.
Devi established the four varnas and defined the four Ashramas and explained the most suitable way to liberation for all beings, through these four stages and varnas.

There are many people who argue that the establishment of varnas and Ashramas are not right. It was created for a good purpose. Brahmins are those who should live solely focused on attaining liberation through Penance, Prayer, Inner and outer Purity, Self-control etc. and they should also become the role model for others. Kshathriyas are those whose vigor, strength and skill is in arms. Their Courage and leadership in war and peace protects the country and its citizens. Vaishya are farmers, protectors of cattle, merchants who trade wisely and make money. Shudras find contentment in serving the society. This system has been put in place for smooth functioning of the society. Education should be given at childhood, because of the sharpness of a child’s memory. This is a stage with no responsibilities, when education can be paramount in life. A forty-five year old, with many responsibilities, will find it very difficult to learn and retain new knowledge. It is a law of nature that a child can absorb knowledge faster. During childhood brahmacharya (bachelorhood) should be maintained. Care should be taken to gain knowledge of the scriptural sciences and skill and learning that are necessary to succeed in this world. This is the goal that should be achieved in Brahmacharyashrama. After gaining all this knowledge, if sufficient purity of the mind is not achieved to be a seeker of the pure self. Grahasthashrama or a married life, with its unique responsibilities, should be entered into. Married life will give the maturity to realize that the pleasures and privileges of this world are fleeting and the desire to know god and attain permanent bliss will become predominant. He will free himself from the bondage of home and family and start Vanaprasthashram, or a life of renunciation. He will accept Sanyasam which looks upon pain and pleasure, loss and fortune with an even and detached mind, from all desire. Renunciation or sacrifice is the biggest component of Sanyas. They do not take anything for themselves. They will use only what is sufficient for themselves, and attain liberation. They will be able to free themselves from the cycle of birth and rebirth and attain liberation. They will be free of rebirth, not having to take life inside another womb. They will not have to drink mothers milk fall sick, then attain puberty and enjoy the luxuries of life. They will not have to grow old and become bedridden. They will not have to go dumb. They will not have to go through birth, death old age sickness, the sorrow of life on this earth. They will understand the futility of such life on earth. They will accept Sanyas, they will discern the universal principle, the truth that god and I are one, they will merge their individual self with the supreme self and reach a state beyond, transcending Turiyam.

Devi is one who establishes and directs the cosmic law of righteousness. “ābrahma kīṭa janani” – She gave birth to all the beings in the universe from brahma to the lowest microbe, and through the establishment of the four varnas and four ashramas, Devi is protecting her children. The four varnas are Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra and the four ashramas are Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, Sanyasa and through them Devi is maintaining and protecting her children. This is the general meaning of the mantra.

Now we are discussing the meaning of the mantras, -
Om ābrahma kīṭa jananyai namaḥ
[who is the mother of everything from Brahma to the lowliest insect.]
Om varṇāśrama vidhāyinyai namaḥ
[who established the order of the social division in life.]

I remember an anecdote related to this. This happened around 80 to 90 years back to the head of the Kanchi ashram, Sri Chandrashekara Saraswathi. The swami has travelled the whole India 3 times. This happened when he was staying in Kolkata. Different types of worships are conducted in their ashram. One of them is called ‘Sumangalai Puja’. In this ceremony married ladies participate. They are honoured and worshipped. This is how it is conducted. At that instance, Sri Rabindranath Tagore was also there at Kolkata. A lady who was staying at Shantiniketan, the university founded by Sri Rabindranath Tagore, wanted to participate in the worship. She was a Brahmin lady from Tamil Nadu. She went to Tagore to get his permission. Tagore agreed. But when she was leaving, he asked a question. “You are going to the ashram of Kanchi to participate in the worship. Only Brahmins are allowed there. Will they allow non Brahmins to participate? Is it not mentioned in the Lalita Sahasranama that Divine Mother is the mother of all?” There was a hint of criticism in what he said. He was questioning the criticism in what he said questioning the supremacy of Brahmins. The Lady did not give any answers. She participated in the worship. It was true that not everybody is not allowed to participate in the worship conducted by that ashram. After worship she went to see the swami personally. She was introduced to the swami. Thus she was also introduced and said that she was staying in Tagore’s Shantiniketan. When she got a chance, she mentioned to swami ji about the questions that Tagore asked. She asked why certain people are not allowed in the ashram. Even though the Divine Mother is the mother of all beings. The swami pondered for some time and asked, “What mantra comes after ‘ābrahma kīṭa janani’? “it is ‘varṇāśrama vidhāyini’ she answered. The meaning of that mantra is ‘She who governs the universe by establishing the order of social division in life’. This social division is needed for the existence and smooth functioning of the society.

The purpose of social division is to establish a system in the society. Only if there is discipline one will be able to progress in life. The basic theory of this order is one should perform the karma that suits him the most. If a maths teacher is sent to wage war against someone he will surely die. A country will collapse if the soldiers do not perform their duty. A merchant should perform his karma. A farmer should carry out his karma. If a weaver is asked to climb up a coconut tree to pluck coconuts he will surely fall down. So everybody must evolve in life performing their duties well. Everybody has a right for God realization. The mantras ‘varṇāśrama vidhāyini’ and ‘ābrahma kīṭa janani’ mean that the Divine mother is the mother of all. She takes effort for uplifting all beings. What is implied here is when we chant Lalita Sahasranama we must understand the meaning of these mantras properly, we must determine the goal of our life, and try consistently for attaining that goal. The head of Kanchi Ashram also meant this. He explained the lady that they are not allowing certain people to participate in the worship because of the social norms that is suggested in the mantra varṇāśrama vidhāyini.

The next mantra that we are going to discuss in Lalita Sahasranama is
Om nijājñā rūpa nigamāyai namaḥ
[whose commands take the form of the Vedas.]
Om puṇyāpuṇya phala pradāyai namaḥ
[who dispenses the fruits of both good and evil actions.]

The Nigamas (Veda) are the real command of the Divine Mother. Nigamas are the commands of the Divine Mother. We are supposed to follow what is instructed in the Nigama – this is the meaning of the, mantra. ‘She whose commands take the form of the Vedas’. The mantra means that her commands have taken the form of Nigamas. We have to understand that Nigamas are the real command of the Divine Mother. We often hear the two words – Agama and Nigama. The meaning of the word Nigama is Veda. The chapters about Jnana (Knowledge), Karma (action) and worship that is given in the Vedas – all these three are called Nigama. There are more than 108 Upanishads. All these explain the real nature of the Supreme Consciousness. That is the chapter about Jnana (knowledge). The Tantras are explained in the chapter about Karma (action). All these together are called Nigamas. Nigamas are the commands of the Divine Mother. The Divine mother wants to follow the instructions in the Vedas. That is the command of the Divine mother. The word ‘Agama’ is used to mean different things. Tantras are books that explain different form of worships. If we follow those worships properly we can attain Knowledge; we can attain liberation. There are three types of Aagama - Shiva Aagamas, Vaishnava Agamas and Shaktha Agamas. It is said that Lord Shiva had created 64 types of Tantras like Shambaram, Jalashambaram etc. & Agamas. By performing Tantras one can attain certain supernatural powers. You will not attain self-realization with supernatural powers. For that the Lord has created Sri Vidya also known as Swatantra Tantra or Brahma Vidya using which many has attained the ultimate goal of self realization. Aagamas are Shiva Aagamas, Vaishnava Agamas and Shaktha Agamas. The Divine Mother instructs the right way of living by Aagamas and Nigamas (Vedas).
This can be explained in another way. Aagamas are Lord Shiva’s Instructions to the Divine Mother. Nigamas are the instructions of the Divine Mother to Lord Shiva. Chapter on Knowledge are the instructions of The Divine Mother to Lord Shiva. Chapters on forms of worship (Tantra) are Lord Shiva’s instructions to The Divine Mother. Some people use the words Nigama for forms of worship (Tantra) and Aagama for knowledge. But mostly the word ‘Aagamas’ is used to Denote the forms of worship to Shiva, Vishnu and the Devi. The part that is about knowledge, which is Upanishads that explains the nature of the Supreme Consciousness is called ‘Nigamas’. The Divine Mother instructs us to follow what is said in the Nigamas. The ultimate goal of life is to attain Supreme Knowledge (Jnana).

ज्ञानाद् एव तु कैवल्यम्
Moksha is attained through Jnana (self-knowledge)
Isavasyopanisad

It is said in the Upanishad that God is Knowledge. The ultimate goal in life is to attain supreme knowledge (jnana). This is the command of the Divine Mother. There are three things that we should observe in this world. First, those duties that is mentioned in the Vedas. Next Aagamas and then Puranas. Aagamas and Puranas are not against Vedas. They help us to follow what is instructed in the Vedas. We should take it as a model and perform our duties as per the direction given in that. Our ancestors lead their lives as directed by Vedas and Puranas. If we also follow ancestor’s ways of life our life will be as per the instructions of the Vedas. In America John Kennedy started to jog. Lakhs of Americans started jogging. Indira Gandhi used to wear a special type of sari and sported distinct hair style. So, many people imitated that. We always imitate what great men choose to do.

यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जन: |
स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते ||
Whatever actions great persons perform, common people follow. Whatever standards they set, all the world pursues.
Gita 3.21
14:07
Whatever a great man does, that other men also do; whatever he sets up as standard, that the world follows. We always do what our spiritual master does. Amma wears a chain made of rudraksha beads. We also wear it. Amma prostrates before everybody when she comes to stage. We also do the same. Like this we always follow what great men do. Suppose father is a smoker. He Smokes. His small baby observes that. He tells his son, “Son, don’t smoke. Smoking is very bad. It affects your lungs”. But even after listening to these words, when he moves away, the son will sit like his father on his chair, roll a piece of paper pretend to smoke. When he finishes high school, the father and son sit together and smoke. Nobody follows what we preach. They follow our actions. It is good to live as per the instructions that is given in the Vedas and scriptures like, Puranas and Itihasas, Tantras and as our ancestors have lived. The difference between our previous generation and us is that they were more composed and brighter than us. Their family bond was much greater than ours. They were happier than us. They never had any facilities that we have now. Good roads, telephone, wealth, good house, electricity- they never had these. But they were much happier than us. The only difference was in observing dharma (righteousness). They led a righteous life, we lost the dharma. The only way we can regain the happiness that our ancestors had is to re-establish the dharma. Let us pray to Amma to give us strength to establish Dharma (righteousness) in our lives.

We understood the meaning of the mantra
Om nijājñā rūpa nigamāyai namaḥ
[whose commands take the form of the Vedas.]
We must follow and obey the cosmic laws laid down in the Vedas. We shall hear a detailed explanation of this mantra. nijājñā rūpa nigamā - puṇyāpuṇya phala pradā”. The meaning of “puṇyāpuṇya phala pradā” is ‘She who dispenses the fruits of actions that are meritorious, and of actions that are not’. When life is lived in obedience to Vedic dharma, happiness is gained. It leads to punya (merit gained by good deeds). Sometimes we knowingly commit bad deeds that are called “prajñāparādham” in Sanskrit. Our intelligence and our memory warns us to refrain from certain actions. But, in spite of it, we perform the action. A perfect example is drinking hard liquor. It is wrong whichever way we look at it. It destroys our memory and brings us disrepute. But even though we know of the harm it does, we continue to drink. We call such actions “prajñāparādham” Devi gives sorrow, or demerits to those who knowingly perform sinful actions. The simplest meaning of this mantra is “She who dispenses the fruits of actions that are meritorious and not meritorious”.

Devi will gives us a birth in accordance with the karma of our previous lives. She gives auspicious lives to those who have performed good actions and sorrow and distress to those who have committed evil, in their previous lives. Devi is a witness to all our actions. There is something we will understand when we listen to this mantra. Lalita Sahasranama was composed by Vashini and the other Vagdevetas. They stand near Devi, their palms joined in devotion, and chant Lalita Sahasranama in Her praise. They are standing very near to Amma. Standing so close to her, they cannot say that results are dispensed in accordance to the performance of good and bad deeds. In Amma’s eyes, there are no sinners. They are standing in close proximity to Her and chanting the mantras. They are the deities of Speech. Words are under their command. They could very easily have chanted “puṇyāpāpa phala pradā”. But they did not do so. We will understand why, when we go near Amma. We cannot go near Amma and say, “he is cruel, he is evil etc.” Because we are all the children of Amma. Very rarely, thieves enter the ashram. We are unable to say anything negative, even about them to Amma. Amma calls them Her “thief children” everybody is Her children. In Lalita Sahasranama, there is a mantra, “heyopādeya varjitā”. The meaning is “She who has nothing to accept or reject”. “dharmādharma vivarjitā” She who transcends both virtue and vice”. In mantra “puṇyāpuṇya phala pradā”, because Vashini and other deities of the word were standing next to Devi, they did not utter the word “papa” (sin). They said, Devi is one who gives results in accordance with the merits and demerits of the deed done.

There is an incident that happened in the life of Sri Sankaracharya. He understood that his mother was on her death bed. He had taken Sanyas only after making a vow to his mother. That he would be there on her death bed. He transported himself through the skies to reach the bed side of his mother Aryamba. She reached the adobe of lord Vishnu, as she breathed her last with her mind fixed upon the lord. As Shankaracharya started the preparations to perform her last rites, the Brahmins objected. They raised objections, “How could a renunciate, who was above the four varnas, participate in cremation, the burning of the body?” Shankaracharya replied, “I have nothing to reject or accept as I have transcended the gunas”. I have transcended the result of actions. I have given my word to my mother”. He performed her cremation with a lit log from the plantain tree.
10:36
Therefore, in the mantra “puṇyāpuṇya phala pradā” Devi stands as the witness to all actions, either meritorious or not and dispenses the results for such actions. She remains a witness, as the fruits of actions are dispensed in accordance with Karmic rules, and guides her children towards spiritual growth. Devi transcends both virtue and unrighteousness. She transcends rejection and acceptance. She transcends good and evil. Because She pervades the whole and dwells in everything. Devi is the ultimate cause of the universe, as it was Her will that created this universe. Therefore, Devi transcends virtue and vice. But even though She transcends virtue and vice, good and evil, it is only through the meritorious deeds of countless previous lives that humanity is able to attain Devi. Only such people will be able to realize Devi.
In “Soundarya Lahari”, Adi Shankara describes Devi as
शिवः शक्त्या युक्तो यदि भवति शक्तः प्रभवितुं
न चेदेवं देवो न खलु कुशलः स्पन्दितुमपि ।
अतस्त्वामाराध्यां हरिहरविरिञ्चादिभिरपि
प्रणन्तुं स्तोतुं वा कथमकृतपुण्यः प्रभवति ॥
Lord Shiva, only becomes able to do creation in this world along with Shakthi. Without her, Even an inch he cannot move, And so how can, one who does not do good deeds, Or one who does not sing your praise, Become adequate to worship you, Oh , goddess of mine, Who is worshipped by the trinity.
Soundarya Lahari 1

the power of action (Shakti), latent in the undivided consciousness, devoid of all attributes (Shiva) “O mother, though of infinite glory, how can ordinary mortals prostrate before you, sing hymns in your praise, or meditate upon you?” “How is it possible for those who have not accrued merit from their previous lives?” It is only through the merit gained from countless lives that one is able to prostrate before Devi, worship Her through music and meditate upon Her effulgent form. It is only through Her infinite grace and blessings that we are able to bow down, with palms joined in devotion, before her glorious form.

Let us listen to the mantra
Om śruti sīmanta sindūrī kṛta pādābja dhūlikāyai namaḥ
[the dust from whose feet forms the vermillion marks at the parting line of the hair of the Sruti devatas (Vedas personified as goddesses).]
Lalita Sahasranama 289

The Vashinyadi Vagdevatas portray a beautiful scene. The meaning of mantra is this. The Shruti devatas are standing before Devi, but a bit distant from her. With palms joined in devotion and tears over flowing from their closed eyes, they stand absorbed in their closed eyes, they stand absorbed in their love for Devi. They look as if they have just prostrated to Devi and stood up. Their foreheads and the parting line of their hair are decorated by the sacred vermilion dust from the lotus feet of Devi. This shows that they have just prostrated to pay their obeisance to Devi, who is their mother. With deep devotion, are standing a little away from Devi. From their demeanour we can see that they consider themselves incapable of understanding and adequately describing the true form of Amma. The meaning of this mantra is explained thus. Shrutis are the Vedas personified as goddesses. The sacred dust from the lotus feet of Devi is glowing as the vermilion marks in the line parting the hair of the Sruti Goddesses. This is the most easily understood meaning.
Vedas consist of three parts. They are Karma Kandam, Upasana Kandam and the Jnana Kandam. The noblest is considered to be the Upanishads. It is the Upanishads that convey to us the unity or oneness of the Jiva to the Brahma. They teach us that the Jivatma (Individual Self) and the Paramatma (Absolute reality) are not two, but one. The Upanishads (A collection of scriptures that contain the central philosophical and scriptural science of ancient Bharatham) propound the theory that the Brahman (Absolute reality) and the Jivatma (the self) are one and only. Therefore, the Upanishads are called the most important part, or the head of the Vedas. The Upanishad deities (mother) prostrated before Devi. The sacred dust from the lotus feet of Devi, was transferred to their foreheads. It was only through Her blessing that they could understand the finite portion of her true form. The Upanishads describe Devi by saying, “Not this, Not this”. They say “I am not Earth, I am not Ether, I am not Air, I am not Fire etc.” It is by saying that “I am not this” “I am not that”, that they are trying to describe Her true form. “I am not the Mind, I am not the Senses, I am not Intelligence, I am not Ego”. Absolute reality is described through the “neti neti vaadam” (“the not this not this” search or analytical meditation). In the Lalitha Sahasranama, Devi has been described as
Om brahmātmaikya svarūpiṇyai namaḥ
[whose nature is the union of Brahman and Atman]

Devi is the Shakti which is not separate from Shiva or the Supreme. Amma is Enthroned in a manner which convinces us that she is the one absolute reality that we have been searching for. This is the reason that the Vedas are standing in front of Devi, with folded palms, bowed heads and tear filled eyes. They stand at some distance away from Devi. We must never think that the master who made us realize the self is the same as us. The attitude of non-duality is not proper in the presence of the Master. Therefore, Shruti goddesses stand a little distance away from Devi. “We have not been able to completely understand and describe the true form of Devi. But we have been able to get a glimpse of Her glory. It is due to the auspiciousness, the sacredness, of the dust from Her lotus feet that is smeared upon our head.” Their posture communicates this thought. Shankaracharya describes the greatness of the dust of the lotus feet of the Devine in the “Saundarya Lahari”.
तनीयांसं  पांसुं  तव चरणपङ्केरुहभवं
विरिञ्चि: सञ्चिन्वन्  विरचयति लोकानविकलं ।
वहत्येनं शौरि: कथमपि सहस्रेण शिरसां
हर: संक्षुद्यैनं भजति भसितोद्धूलनविधिम् ॥
Lord Brahma ,the creator of yore, selects a dust from your feet, and creates the worlds,
The great Adisesha with his thousand heads, Some how carries a dust of your feet,
17:05
With geat effort, and the great Lord Rudra, takes it and powders it nice, and uses it as the holy ash.
Soundarya Lahari 2

The second verse says that Brahma gathered a miniscule amount of the dust of Her lotus feet. Thus he created the universe and all the other worlds from the sacred dust of Her lotus feet. ‘Bhur Bhuvah Swahaha’ are the upper worlds, the nether worlds are Paathala, Athala, Vithala, Suthala etc. Devi was walking in the garden of Sri Nagara, accompanied by Her cohorts of Yoginis. This was very rare happening and Brahma was present there, as Devi walked with her companions (The Yoginis). Brahma was able to see very clearly the lotus feet of the Devi. He prostrated happily at the sight of Her lotus feet. With great devotion he gathered a minute mote of dust. With unparalleled power of the sacred dust, he created all the worlds. He became renowned and glorified as the creator of all the worlds. Vishnu on seeing the renown of Brahma, decided that he also wanted to take part in this bewitching game of Devi. Vishnu also gathered a mote of sacred dust from her lotus feet, He took on the incarnation of Shouri, the thousand hooded AdiShesha. He bore the weight of the worlds with his thousand heads. When Lord Parama Shiva observed the glory of lord Brahma and Maha Vishnu, he also decided to play a part. He wanted a role in Her divine play. He prostrated before Devi Parameshwari, he gathered a mote of sacred dust from her lotus feet and mixed it with the sacred ash that he smeared upon his body. With great respect, he smeared the sacred ash all over his body. He became the destroyer. Creation, Maintenance and Destruction are three of the divine attributes of the divine dust from the lotus feet of Devi. In Lalita Sahasranama, one of the mantras is
Om tirodhāna karyai namaḥ
[who causes the disappearance of things.]
Lalita Sahasranama 270

The illusionary power of Maya is annihilated by the blessings conferred by Devi. She grants the knowledge of oneness. Creation, Maintenance, Destruction, the annihilation of the illusionary power of Maya and the blessings which confers the knowledge of the union of the individual Self with the Supreme, are all attributes of the sacred dust from the lotus feet of Devi. Knowing this, the Shruti goddesses prostrated before the holy feet of Devi. They wore on their forehead, as sacred vermilion marks, dust from the lotus feet of Devi. They stood a little apart from her, bashful and silent, with the attitude that, they knew only a very little of her glory. In the mantra “śruti sīmanta sindūrī kṛta pādābja dhūlikā”, we see a beautiful visual representation of Devi with the Sruti(Vedic) goddesses.

In the Lalita Sahasranama, we have heard the descriptions of the mantras “ābrahma kīṭa Janani - varṇāśrama vidhāyini - nijājñā rūpa nigamā - puṇyāpuṇya phala pradā” “Devi is not only the creator who is the mother to all, from Brahma to the littlest living thing, she established the social order, the four varnas and four Ashramas necessary for each stage of life. She is not only the creator, but each birth is granted by her to experience the result of past actions from previous lives. Devi guides them to exhaust their karma and attain liberation, which is the ultimate goal of life. She is also nijājñā rūpa nigamā (287), puṇyāpuṇya phala pradā (288) Through Nigamas, Agamas, Shasthras, (Hindhu scriptural sciences) and sacred rituals Devi guides us into upholding the right values in life. One of the most essential qualities of the devotees of Devi is that they must bear no malice, nor should they demean, whether it may be the arts, or people of different religions, whether they are devotees of Shiva or Vishnu. All paths ultimately lead to Devi. This is called “nahi ninda nyayam” where no person, art or object is demeaned. The philosophy advises us to adore the Devi within our hearts, dress in a manner befitting the devotees of Shiva by wearing rudraksha and sacred ash, and live in the manner of a devotee of Vishnu, following their food habits, restrained behaviour and sweet words. This is advised by the Shakthas. Devotion to Shiva, Vishnu or Devi is not separate from one another. A true devotee of Devi would want to hear numerous stories of Vishnu, sing hymns in praise of him and chant his names. There is a very popular evening prayer chanted in Kerala “Shiva Rama Govinda Narayana Mahadeva Krishna Hare Hare Krishna Mahadeva Narayana Govinda Rama Shiva” This is chanted as the evening prayer. The holy names of Shiva, Rama, Govinda, Mahadeva, Krishna are not different from each other. They should all be chanted. There should be no discrimination between Shiva and Vishnu and Shakti .

The next mantra in Lalita Sahasranama is about nāda (sound). This is a topic that we normally do not think about. Devi is praised as nāda rūpā - nāma rūpa vivarjitā (299, 300). The Lalita Sahasranama reveals that naadam (sound) has four classifications. “parā pratyak citī rūpā – paśyanti para devatā – madhyamā vaikharī rūpā - bhakta mānasa haṁsikā.” The four forms of sound are classified as parā, paśyanti, madhyamā and vaikharī. We do not usually think about sound that is unmanifest or inaudible. We consider sound to be only that which is audible to our ears. This gross, manifest and audible sound is called Vaikhari. Sound has subtle and unmanifest stages also. Parā is the state of utmost subtlety (366). Paśyanti is the second level of sound after Parā (367). Madhyamā – she who stays in the middle between the subtle and the gross (368). Vaikharī is the sound in the gross, manifested form audible to the ear (371). Let us take the example of the sun before and after sunrise. There is darkness before sunrise, nothing is clear to us. We are unable to see anything with our eyes. After a while a dim light seeps in. Things become clearer as the sky becomes lighter and the sun dawns up I the sky. In midway the sun is blazing high above us, where everything is clear. In the same manner, Vaikharī is the sound that our external ears are capable of hearing in the most gross, audible and manifest form. Madhyamā is twilight. The time of the day just before twilight, when things can be dimly perceived is Paśyanti, para is the unclear, unseen. In the individual, power of speech resides in the kundalini and our prowess in speech depends on the latent tendencies of our past lives. The source of sound resides at such a subtle level. We call it para. Paśyanti has a simple form, but it has not become a sound or a syllable. Such a stage is called Paśyanti. Madhyamā is the middle stage, where sound becomes more amplified and clear. Vaikharī is the sound that we hear, that becomes manifest as audible syllables. The origin of sound is the kuṇḍalini (110) arising from the ‘anāhatābja’ ajna chakra, (103) viśuddhi cakra (475) in Lalita Sahasranama.

Mantra Chanting is an important topic in Sri Lalita Sahasranama. So far we have discussed the creation and evolution (of an individual soul), the relevance of Vedas and Agamas, Dharma (righteous deeds) and the goal of life which is liberation. Chanting mantra as a spiritual practice is most essential for the evolution of an individual soul. Worship helps you to attain liberation very fast, and chanting mantra is most suitable for that. In the 1000 names of the Divine Mother this is mentioned briefly in the mantras like “hrīmkārī, hrīmatī” etc. For a spiritual practitioner material possessions are not important. His wealth is his mantra. He gains as much as he chants his mantra. It never goes in vain. So we will discuss that in detail here. There is a mantra in Lalita Sahasranama

om hrīmkāryai namaḥ
[who is in the form of the syllable hrim.]

This mantra is also there in many other hymns. Like ‘Hrimkara Mantrojwala’ in the hymn Meenakshi Pancharatna. This is discussed in more detail in Lalita Trishati. Lalitha Trishati is the 300 names of the Divine Mother. In those three hundred names 60 mantras are about the syllable ‘Hrim’. In the first 100 names, the mantras from 80 to 100 is about the mantra ‘Hrim’. After that mantras from 200 to 220, and the last 280 to 300 are about ‘Hrim’ mantra. So mantras from 80 to 100, 200 to 220 and 280 to 300 are about ‘Hrim’. From this we can understand the importance of this mantra. ‘Hrim’ is the fifth syllable in the form of worship called Sri Vidya. So this mantra is present in Sri Vidya also. We can see in various temples that this mantra is inscribed like ‘Om Hrim Parashakthyai Namaha’ or ‘Om Hrim Namah Shivaya’.

The relevance of Lalita Sahasranama is that many mantras from this hymn are used by spiritual masters for initiating their disciples.
Another meaning of the word ‘Hrim’ is shame. Dignified people will surely feel ashamed if they knowingly did something that they should not do. Because of this feeling of shame we understand our mistakes and would never repeat them. This is one meaning of the word ‘Hrim’. In the mantra ‘Hrim’, there are 3 notes – ‘h, r, i’ followed by ‘m’. All these seed letters include in the mantra. In general, these syllables denote the three qualities of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas followed by that which transcends all these – The Self. The mantra also denotes the principles of Brahma, Vishnu, Maheshwara and the most exalted Divine Mother and creation, preservation, destruction and Pure Consciousness. Thus these seed syllables are very meaningful. We must not think that these syllables are meaningless sounds. All the seed syllables have particular meaning. Suppose we take some medicine. The doctor prescribes some medicine. We do not care about components of the concoction. We take it as prescribed by the doctor. And we surely have its benefits. Like that we receive mantra from the Guru and we practice it as instructed by the Guru. The guru explains the meaning of the mantra and how to practice it. Because the guru is so pure we also receive a fraction of their immense energy.
03:28
Those who practice the chanting of mantra will be able to attain liberation in this life itself. Thus this mantra teaches us the importance of the practice of mantra. This mantra – Om Hrimkaryai namah of Lalita Sahasranama helps us to understand the importance of chanting mantra. By the spiritual practice of the mantra we are freed from all types of fears. Fear here means worldly fear. Chanting mantra relieves us from the distress of worldly life. At the same time, it releases us from the cycle of life and death. It is also said that whoever sings its glory are freed from worldly pains. Amma gives a beautiful example. We write a notice on the wall, “Don’t stick bills”. This one sentence written on the wall keeps the rest of the wall without any writing. Like that, we receive a mantra and chant it. We meditate on its meaning. This thousand Names of the Divine Mother is a garland of mantras. Different names are given as per the letters of the mantra. Spiritual practices of goddess are called ‘Vidya’. When it is more than 24 letters it is called a chain of mantras. This thousand names of Divine Mother are a chain of mantras. We chant it, meditate on its meaning. Because of this we are relieved from worldly fears. Even if we know that we have Amma’s blessings. Amma will always protect us, mantras liberate us from this world. This mantra, ‘om hrīmkāryai namaḥ’ helps us to proceed in the spiritual practice.

We were discussing the mantra, om hrīmkāryai namaḥ
We already said that in #Lalita Trishati the mantras from 80 to 100 are about ‘hrīm’. The following are the mantras –
07:59
hrīṁkāra rūpā - hrīṁkāra nilayā - hrīṁpadapriyā - hrīṁkāra bījā - hrīṁkāramantrā - hrīṁkāralakṣaṇā - hrīṁkārajapa suprītā - hrīṁmati - hrīṁvibhūṣaṇā - hrīṁśīlā - hrīṁpadārādhyā -hrīṁgarbhā - hrīṁpadābhidhā - hrīṁkāravācyā - hrīṁkāra pūjyā - hrīṁkāra pīṭhikā - hrīṁkāra vēdyā - hrīṁkāra cintyā - hrīṁ - hrīṁśarīriṇi. These are the 20 mantras from 80 to 100 in Lalita Trishati. Now we will discuss very briefly the meaning of these 20 mantras. The first mantra among these is “hrīṁkāra rūpā”. Hrim is the 5th seed syllable of the Pancha Dashakshari mantra (mantra with 15 syllables). The meaning of the mantra is - ‘Hrim’ is one of the forms of the Divine Mother. The next mantra is “hrīṁkāra nilayā”, which means that the abode of the Divine Mother is ‘Hrim’. During the day time we go out for work or to some other place. Where ever we go, we come back home for rest. We get peace when we come back home. Like that the abode of Devine mother is always Hrim. The next mantra “hrīṁpadapriyā” – Devine mother Loves those who chant this mantra knowingly or unknowingly. The Devine mother loves this term Hrim. It can be also interpreted as the ultimate position, the most exalted state of liberation. The state of Hrim is liberation and the Devine Mother loves those who try to attain that. The mantra that comes after this is hrīṁkāra bījā – The seed of the big Peepal tree is very small. From such a small seed grows the big tree with its trunk, branches, roots, and fruits. Many birds rest in that tree. The big tree exists in the small seed. Like that the whole universe exists in the mantra ‘Hrim’. The Divine Mother is “hrīṁkāra bījā”. The next mantra is “hrīṁkāramantrā”. It is enough to chant just this mantra ‘Hrim’. This “hrīṁkāramantrā” protects those who meditate on it. Hrim Kara is the characteristic feature of the Divine Mother. As discussed earlier there are four syllables in hrīṁ – h, r, i, m. The mantra denotes the trinities of Brahma, Vishnu, Maheshwara, and the most exalted Devine Mother, and the cosmos which is the aggregate of three qualities, followed by that which transcends all these - The Self. We can say that if ever there is any characteristic feature for the Divine Mother it is Hrim. The mantra “hrīṁkārajapa suprītā”- The Devine Mother is very much pleased with those who do their spiritual practices systematically and those who practice the chanting of ‘Hrim’ considering it as the Divine Mother. The mantra “hrīṁvibhūṣaṇā” – If we describe someone as wearing a necklace or earring, we will have a picture of that person in our mind. Like that the whole universe is the Divine Mother’s adornments. The Shakta Philosophy says that the Divine Mother who has no name or form has evolved as the universe with names and forms. It doesn’t deny the universe saying that it is all Maya, illusion. In Shakta Philosophy everything has its significance saying that the entire universe is the manifestation of the Divine Mother. The meaning of the mantra “hrīṁvibhūṣaṇā” is that all animate beings and inanimate things in the universe are the decorations of the Divine Mother. When we understand that these animate beings and the inanimate things are the ornaments of the Divine Mother, we will never hate anything in this universe. The next mantra is “hrīṁśīlā”. The trinities are mentioned here. Here creation, preservation, and destruction are happening without any break. That is Divine Mother’s deed. The mantra “hrīṁśīlā” denotes the Divine Mother’s action of creation, preservation, and destruction. The next mantra is “hrīṁpadārādhyā”. The Divine Mother is glorified by all those who worship this mantra. They chant the mantra with the Goddess in their hearts. “hrīṁgar-bhā” is the next mantra. The whole universe is in the womb of the Divine Mother. She is the cause of creation, preservation, and destruction. Thus this mantra is very suitable for her. “hrīṁpadābhidhā” – The Divine Mother is indicated with the word Hrim. “hrīṁkāravācyā” – The meaning of the word Hrim is Divine Mother. “hrīṁkāra pūjyā” – The Divine Mother is to be worshipped with Hrim.
07:59
“hrīṁkāra pīṭhikā” – The Goddess sits in the seat called Hrim. “hrīṁkāra cintyā” – The Divine Mother is to be meditated as Hrim. “hrīm” - The Divine Mother is addressed as Hrim. “hrīṁśarīriṇī” - The body of the Divine Mother is Hrim. These are very brief meaning of the Hrim mantras. There are five seed syllables, Hrim, Shrim, Klim, etc which are called Pancha Pranava mantras. The Divine Mother is worshipped with all these. The Hrim mantra is also the combination of Shiva and Shakti. Hrim is also considered as the combination of knowledge and ignorance. Thus this mantra “om hrīmkāryai namaḥ”. #LalitaSahasranama explains to us the importance of mantra worship.

We were discussing on the commentary to the mantra
Om hrīmkāryai namaḥ
[who is in the form of the syllable hrim.]
In Lalita Trisati, the syllable hrim is used in 60 different ways and we started seeing a brief commentary on those mantras. Earlier we discussed on 80-100 mantras from Trisati. Now we will see the mantras 200-220 from Lalita Trisati.
The next three mantras are
Om hrīṁkāriṇyai namaḥ
[… who is the personified by the bija ‘`Hrim`’; the eleventh letter of the panchadasakshari mantra]
Om hrīṁkārādyāyai namaḥ
[… who is the origin of Hrim and Om]
Om hrīṁmaddhyāyai namaḥ
[… who is in the midst of Hrim]

hrīṁkāriṇi means one who created the bija mantra hrim. These mantras are not created to exhibit the Sanskrit prowess by the sages, rishis are said to be the seers of the mantras, not the creators. Certain aspects of rituals and sadhana are created, for example, Kadi Vidya and Hadi Vidya in Shakta tradition is attributed to Kamadeva & Lopamudra respectively. In reality, all the mantras have originated from the pure consciousness that is Devi. Hence Devi is hrīṁkāriṇi and hrīṁkārādyā. Hrīṁmaddhyā also means that this syllable, Hrim is at the center of everything. Objects in this universe are of two types, one being made of pure energy and the other made of the five elements. Supreme Consciousness, Devi is considered as the primordial cause of these two classes. In Tarkka Shasthra, there are two causes described, 1. Nimitta Kaaranam, 2. Upaadaana Kaaranam.

Upaadaana Kaaranam means, for example, mud and a mud pot. Without mud, a mud-pot cannot exist. Without the thread, a cloth cannot exist. Without gold, ornaments cannot exit. In a similar way, this universe cannot exist without Devi. Nimitta Kaaranam is, the one who makes the ornaments or furniture, lie black-smith, carpenters etc. That is also Devi as She is creatrix. Hence it is said that there is nothing other than Devi in this universe. She is both the Nimitta & the Upaadaana. So, hrīṁmaddhyā denotes that Devi is at the center of everything, the cause of the universe. From the next mantra onwards in Lalita Trishati, there are beautiful 36 examples being described. The natural forces that we see in our daily lives like rain, moonlight, cyclones, sunrise & set, wild animals in the forest, whatever we see around, the following mantras reminds us that all these are nothing but Devi’s various manifestations.

The next mantra is Om hrīṁśikhāmaṇayē namaḥ
[… who wears hrim in her head as ornament]
We wear many kinds of ornaments and among the parts of our body, the head is considered as the most important as it is the seat of vision, taste, hearing, and intellect. Hastasya Bhooshanam Daanam, means, for the hands, the beauty comes from doing charity & serving others and not by wearing any ornaments. In a similar way it is through the senses on our head we perceive this universe and our thoughts take place. Hence the ornament worn on the head is very important. Devi wears a beautiful crown on Her head and on that crown is the most valuable jewel (Choodamani). Hence hrīṁśikhāmaṇi means, hrim is the most important among other mantras. It is like the jewel on the crown. We are seeing those part that explains about the importance of practice of mantra. We are discussing the meaning of the mantra Om hrīmkāryai namaḥ from Lalita Sahasranama. This entire part depicts the importance of Hrimkara mantra and it’s practice. This is expanded to 60 mantras in Lalita Trishati. These can be considered as the commentary for the Hrim syllable. We have seen a brief meaning of a few of those mantras. The next mantra is
Om hrīṁkārakuṇḍāgni śikhāyai namaḥ
[… who is the flame of the fire place (homa kundam) called hrim]
The fire oblations (homa) begins with the construction of the fire pit (homa kunda). Cleaning the space, building-up the homa kundam in the most revered way. Using the right and auspicious materials to perform the oblations. Using the right chanting of mantras and offering the sacrifices. All these lead to the said benefits of the homa.

We were seeing the meaning of the mantra
Om hrīṁ kāryai namaḥ
[who is in the form of the syllable hrim.]
We were discussing the connected mantras in Lalita Trisati related to hrīṅ kāryai namaḥ and continuing with
Om hrīṁkārakuṇḍāgni śikhāyai namaḥ
[… who is the flame of the fire place (homa kundam) called hrim]
The most important part of the fire offering happens in the sikha (the top of the flame). The fire should be live without smoke and the tip of the flame is where the offerings are made. If the fire is not continuous or smoky it is not considered as auspicious. Devi is compared to the most important part of the offering as the flame. Which means Devi is the central aspect of the hrimkara japa sadhana. If we are chanting this by remembering Her form, it will brant us both materialistic and spiritual well being. This is what this mantra signifies.
The next 3 mantras are familiar to us as see those in nature
Om hrīṁkāra śaśicandrikāyai namaḥ
[… who is the nectar like rays of the light of the moon called `Hrim`]
A person who is tired of his day’s activities, who is exhausted and worried is relieved at the sight of a soothing full moon. In a similar way, people who are delved into sadhana of chanting Her names, are relieved from the worldly sorrows. Like a joyful spring after the hot summer. The chanting of a mantra received from their Guru will bestow happiness and contentment. It is like the soothing rays of the full moon.

Next mantra is Om hrīṁkāra bhāskararucayē namaḥ
[… who is the lustre and brightness in the sun called `Hrim`]
Ruchi in samkritam has two meanings. One is taste and another meaning is the brightness. Like the clouds that clouts the Sun, the ever shining knowledge within us is blocked by our ignorance. To understand that knowledge within us we don’t need any other knowledge as it is self-effulgent. But it is hindered by the clouds of our ignorance. The chanting of mantras continuously and contemplating on the spiritual principles will help us to remove the darkness of ignorance and reveal the light of knowledge. This highlights the importance of Sadhana and mantra japa. This mantra help us to remind that principle whenever we see the natural elements.


Next mantra is Om hrīṁkārāṁbhōdacañcalāyai namaḥ
[… who is the lightning in the black clouds called `Hrim`]
Ambhodam are thunder clouds, cancalam is the lightining. When it rains, we see the clouds when the lighting struck. It is the lighting that shows the presence of the clouds. In the same way in this materialistic world, we are unable to decipher the principle of Devi. Devi is the foundational principle of this entire. Universe and She is the lightning or the light that shines everything else in this universe. Devi is the prime object of contemplation in the path of hrimkara sadhana.

Whenever we see the sun, moon, rain clouds, lightning, these mantras helps us to remember Mother.

kṣarākṣarātmikā-sarva lokeśi-viśva dhāriṇi, all these mantras of Lalita Sahasranama reminds us She is pervading in the entire universe.

We are listening to the commentary of the mantra Om hrīmkāryai namaḥ [who is in the form of the syllable hrim.], in the Lalita Sahasranama. We are looking into the mantras in the Lalitha Trishati that details the different aspects of this mantra. The next mantra in the Lalitha Trishathi is
Om hrīṁkārakandāṁkurikāyai namaḥ
[… who is the germinating tendril of the tuber called `Hrim`]
Devi is the sprout of “Hrimkara”. From the tuber root, sprouts two leaves on the slender stem. This is called the ‘ankuram’. It is this slender sprout that grows into a strong plant and a stout tree. Tree grows strong branches and its branches bear fruits. It becomes an immense presence, giving shade and support to all. In the same manner Devi is the seed and the sprout to this Universe. We see the universe as “Many”. We see the roots, the trunk, branches, the fruits as Many and different from each other. But the source of all this is the seed and the sprout that is Devi.
The next mantras are
Om hrīṁkāradīr-ghikāhaṁsyai namaḥ
[… who is the she swan playing in the pond called `Hrim`]
Om hrīṁkārōdyānakēkinyai namaḥ
[… who is the peahen playing in the garden of `Hrim`]
These mantras are also connected to natural sights. A lake in which we can see swans swimming. At times we can see a swan all by itself, in the lake. Devi is the lovely swan in the lake of Hrimkara. (hrīṁkāradīr-ghikāhaṁsi). In the garden of Hrimkara Devi is the resplendent peacock (hrīṁkārōdyānakēkini). These mantras describe the happiness experienced by those who are enmeshed in the worldly affairs, when they are able to see a Mahatma. They have never before seen such a sight. The experience an indefinable, sublime happiness when they meet Amma. They have walked from morning to night on a barren road, hungry, thirsty and tired and then they spy a clear water lake. They rest by its side, drink the clear water and happily watch the swans swimming regally in the lake. They feel rested and refreshed. Swans live only in clear water lakes. Swans have another ability. When milk water is given to them, they will drink only the milk, and leave the water untouched. Life consists of the good and the bad, virtue and vice. We might, even though we might know it to be a vice, become enslaved to alcohol or some other ruinous habits. We lose our sense of discernment. Swans are a symbol of discernment. A sincere spiritual practitioner must be able to eschew vice and embrace virtue. This is the lesson given to us by the Swan. In the manner that a tired traveller rests. And regain strength under the shelter of the shade of the tree, the darshan of Mahatma rejuvenates his self. When we take refuge in Parashakthi, we are able to regain happiness, as Devi uplifts us from the great sorrows of life. We go in search of solitude in gardens when we long for some rest or for relaxation from an unquiet mind. We see huge trees, creepers and flowering bushes in a garden. We see green meadows. But crowning glory of a garden is the presence of peacocks. The peacock travels among the trees and on the green meadows. The Universe is made up of manifold manifestations of Devi. It is her energy that permeates everywhere. Devi compared to the peacock that roams free everywhere in the garden, and adds beauty and brilliance by its presence. Devi is the self that shines through every being and everything, she is the pure Self of the Universe. She is the beauty and the cosmic power that engenders the universe. The two mantras direct us to think constantly of Parashakthi or the cosmic power behind this Universe.

The next two mantras of the Lalitha Trishathi are
Om hrīṁkārāraṇya hariṇyai namaḥ
[… who is the doe (female deer) playing in the forest of `Hrim`]
Om hrīṁkārālavālavallyai namaḥ
[… who is the ornamental climber in the flower bed of `Hrim`]
12:13
A forest is made of thousands of trees, creepers, bushes, plants and animals. Initially, one is afraid to enter the forest. But being captivated by the beauty of the forest one ventures in. You feel safe at the entrance of the forest. But as you venture into the deep and dark interiors, suddenly you become aware of your aloneness, of the tigers, bears and elephants that roam freely in the forest. Fear overtakes you. In the same manner, initially you hesitate to enter this world of illusions and delusions, then we slowly step in, we experience the ties of family, sorrow and happiness visit our lives and we become unable to free ourselves of our various bonds. We feel as if we are trapped within a forest. If we are trapped within a forest and we come across a deer, our heart lightens up. The doe is travelling alone, it has beautiful eyes and a graceful figure and its peaceful presence assure us that no carnivorous animals are present in the vicinity and gives happiness to our heart, in the forest of the world. Devi is the doe in the forest of “Hrimkaram”. This mantra advises those who are trapped in the worldly life, to take refuge in Devi. We shall hear the glorious attributes of Devi, in further classes.

The next two mantras are
Om hrīṁkārakandarā siṁhyai namaḥ
[… who is the lioness living in the cave called `Hrim`]
Om hrīṁkārāṁbhōja bhr̥ṁgikāyai namaḥ
[… who is the bee playing in the lotus flower called `Hrim`]

A possible explanation for the mantra hrīṁkārakandarā siṁhi can be as follows, There is a cave on top of a mountain. There is a cave on top of the Himalayas. Devi is the lioness whose den is the cave. Usually people do not climb up to the top of the mountains. Even if they do, if they spy a cave a they will never enter it. This is a hint that people who are immersed in worldly affairs do not enter the spiritual path. Mountaineers who take up the risky climb, are very rare. Of those brave souls who reach the top of the mountains, only a very few venture inside any caves that they might see. This is because they do not want to encounter any wild and carnivorous animal that might inhabit the cave. Animals, who know that it is the den of the lioness, stay away from its surroundings. Elephants, strong and powerful, might venture near. But they will meet their death at the hands of the lioness. It is said that the lioness will take the pearls that are to be found inside the head of noble elephants.

bhajanti tvāṃ dhanyāḥ katichana chidānanda-laharīm
Fortunate are those few, who worship Thee, the inundation of Bliss-Consciousness
Soundarya Lahari 8

To make the comparison, not many people devote themselves exclusively to realize the universal truth, that is the divine consciousness embodied as Parashakthi, who is the reason and the foundation of this universe. It is very rarely that people go mountaineering, climb to the top, and with great courage enter alien caves. It is only through
“abhyāsātiśaya jñātā [who is known only through the strenuous practice of spiritual discipline]”- (990). Devi is the lioness whose abode is the cave on the peak of the perilous mountain. It is almost impossible, it is extremely difficult to approach Devi. We chant “Durgama”, “Durga” (189,190). She who can be approached only with extreme effort. (683) She who can be attained through an easy and brilliant path. “ābāla gopa viditā [who is known well by all]
” (994) She who can be known with ease by small children and cowherds. A high level of education or Scholarship in Sanskrit and the scriptural sciences or Vedas are not essential to attain Devi. Devi is Lalitha. (The pleasant and playful one.) But even then, it is foolish to think that Devi can be attained by those who live ordinary lives. “hrīṁkārakandarā siṁhi” Devi is the lioness whose abode is the cave of Hrim, who lives inside the cave of the intense spiritual practices. Devi is the lioness who can be attained only through intense spiritual practices.


The next mantra is hrīṁkārāṁbhōja bhr̥ṁgikā
11:42
Devi is the honey bee coming in search of the lotus that is the “Hrimkaram”. The lotus is most beautiful and is filled with more honey than other flowers. Bees come in search of lotus flowers before flying off to look for honey in the other places. The lotus flower is the symbol of liberation, Ashtasiddhi (eight mystical perfections or divine powers) and Ashtaishwarya (the eight types of wealth.) Devi comes to this lotus flower. Devi comes in search of this lotus flower. Spiritual aspirants who practice the “Hrimkara Sadhana” attain Devi with more ease than aspirants who follow other methods of spiritual practice. We Take refuge in god. God must also come in search of us. We must become ideal spiritual practitioners, so that we become beloved to god and god comes in search of us. We must become ideal spiritual practitioners, so that we become beloved to God and God comes in search of us. Self-realization or union with the universal being is possible to those who have ideal qualities. The Lotus has all such ideal qualities. The Lotus incorporates within itself the eight mystical perfections, the eight types of wealth and the salvation of the self. Devi becomes drawn to such a flower. Therefore, those who worship and continuously chant this mantra will effortlessly gain the merit needed for the blessings of Devi. Devi will come in search of them. “hrīṁkārāṁbhōja bhr̥ṁgikā” – She who can be attained effortlessly by intense spiritual practitioners, who possess ideal qualities. Those who worship the ‘Hrimkara Mantra’ gain Devi with more ease.

We are hearing the various explanations of the mantra. ‘Hrimkaryai Namaha’ in the Lalitha Sahasranama

We are listening to the commentary on the mantra “Om hrīmkāryai namaḥ” in the Lalitha Sahasranama. This mantra is explained in greater detail, as sixty mantras, in the Lalitha Trishathi. We are looking into the interpretation of those sixty mantras. The Lalitha Trishati is commonly chanted all over Kerala.
The next two mantras are
Om hrīṁkāratarumañjaryai namaḥ
[… who is the flower bunch in the tree called `Hrim`]
Om hrīṁkārasumanōmādhvyai namaḥ
[… who is the honey in the flower called `Hrim`]


Devi is the nectar, the honey that is found in the flower that is the “Hrimkaram”. Flower blooms and the bees come to sip the nectar that is the honey. They carry the pollen to other areas. Pollination increases and ensures the continuation of the plant species. This is the end goal. In the same manner, Devi is the abstract, the intangible, inner meaning that is the goal of every Sadhana. Honey is the reason for the pollination that ensures the continuation of the plant species. Devi manifests as the nectar of the flower that is “Hrimkaram”. She stands as the goal, the pure inner element within the flower of “Hrimkara”. We have seen boughs laden with flowers. Especially during Onam, we see flower laden branches everywhere. “hrīṁkāra-taru-mañjari”. We see the mango tree full of flower laden boughs which later transforms into small green mangoes. Devi is the flower laden branch in the tree of “Hrimkara”, this is the meaning of the mantra “hrīṁkāra-taru-mañjari”. This is an indication that the flowers will evolve into ripe fruits. A spiritual aspirant accepts a Guru, either longing for self-realization or to realize some goal in life. He receives a mantra from his Guru. He tries sincerely to chant the mantra and perform spiritual practices in obedience to his Gurus instructions, with an understanding of its meaning and the universal principle underlying it. He chants it with pure motive, without fail and in accordance with the rules set down. His desires, both aihikam (pertaining to this world, earthly pleasures) and aamushmikam (pertaining to the other world, salvation) will be granted. We might pray for a cure from a chronic disease. We might pray for an end to sorrow. The ultimate goal for everybody is an end to all sorrow. This is the reason why we accept a mantra and chant it regularly, whether it is Hrimkara mantra or not. Devi is the flower laden branches of the tree of “Hrimkara”. We do not know how to cross over this ocean of samsara. We are standing on the bank of a river longing to cross over to the other side. Wooden boats carry us across the river, to reach the opposite bank. This is what we call as a “Thaaraka Mantra”, The mantra comparable to a boat that will carry us. Across the ocean of Samsara and deliver us from the cycle of birth and rebirth. “Mantra Sadhana”, chanting the mantra in the prescribed manner and obeying the words of the Guru, helps us to cross over. If Upasana, or worship, is the tree, then Devi is the flower laden bough of the tree of worship. Every day, whenever we see flowers, the Lalitha Trishathi reminds us that they are the forms of Devi and gives us the reassurance of reaching the goal. The next three mantras are hrīṁkāra mūrtti - hrīṁ-kāra saudhaśr̥ṁga kapōtikā - hrīṁkāra dugdhābdhi sudhā
Devi is the in dweller in the three qualities of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas and pure intelligence beyond these three qualities. The form of Devi is composed of the three qualities and is also pure intelligence, the eternal indestructible consciousness that is beyond logic and perception. This is the meaning of the mantra
Om hrīṁkāra mūrttyai namaḥ
[… who is the personified by bija hrim; the fifteenth and last letter of the panchadasakshari manthra]

The next mantra is
Om hrīṁ-kāra saudhaśr̥ṁga kapōtikāyai namaḥ
[… who is the pigeon who lives on the top of the palace called `Hrim`]
13:55
A picture upholds before our eyes. We see the highest tower of a magnificent palace. A bird sits on the highest point of the tower, eyes half closed in serene solitude. The bird is totally relaxed. This is the emotion that the picture evokes and imparts to us. The kings who wish for rest and quietness usually move to the upper reaches of the palace on a full moon night. They relax in the luminous glow of the moon light as they enjoy the peace of the night. In the same manner, the initial phases of spiritual practices are very intense. When the noble qualities of spiritual aspirants strengthen as a result of disciplined and constant practice, they reach the heights. They become aware of the presence of Devi, near them. They stay there immersed in meditation. They meditate, with half closed eyes, like a bird that even with eyes open is always alert to its inner world. They look inside themselves, sitting with half closed eyes. The bird is absorbed in the bliss of the realized Self. It is standing with eyes veiled in rapture. In the same manner the mind of the spiritual practitioner raises up, freeing itself from the turbulent emotions of desire and anger and reaches the heights where it experiences restful bliss. The sign of this is the mantra “hrīṁ-kāra saudhaśr̥ṁga kapōtikā”. Here intense spiritual practice is represented as the palace and Devi is represented as the lovely bird residing at the pinnacle, standing motionless and absorbed in the bliss of the Self. This is the meaning of the mantra “hrīṁ-kāra saudhaśr̥ṁga kapōtikā”. We are looking into the meanings of the various mantras of the most ideal “Lalitha Sahasranama”. We shall hear more about the glorious attributes of Devi in the coming episodes.

“hrīṁkāra dugdhābdhi sudhā” is the next mantra. Dugdham means milk. Abdhi means ocean. Sudha means – Ambrosia. Devi is the ambrosial nectar in the ocean of milk. We all know popular legend of the churning of the ocean of milk. There lay a lot of precious things at the bottom of the ocean. With the help of the mountain Manthara , Devas tried to churn the ocean to retrieve the treasures. When they realized that this was a difficult feat, they sought the help of Asuras, on condition that the treasures would be shared. Thus, began the churning of the ocean of milk. While churning, many treasures surfaced. Among them, the most prized thing was Amritam (Ambrosia) . Those who drank Amritam could become immortal. This made them Devas. Devas have no Birth and Death. The most precious things began coming out from the churning of the ocean like Iravatha (The Celestial Elephant), Uchaisravas (The Celestial Horse) etc, among that Amritam being the most precious. Hreemkara Sadhana (or) Mantra Upasana means churning the ocean of milk. Like the churning, if we can churn out our mental impurities like Kama, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Madha, & Matsarya, we can get the purity needed to pave the way to Moksha. Amrita is compared to Moksha here. Amrita makes one immortal, in a similar way Moksha takes us beyond the circle of birth and death. This can be experienced in this life itself, it is called Jivan Mukthi. This is the utltimate goal of life – This is Parameshwari. Realizing Devi is the goal of life, as explained in this Mantra. hrīm kāri-hrīmati-hṛdyā is the section from Lalitha Sahasranama that we are discussing now.
In Lalitha Trishati, 60 mantras explain more about ‘Hreemkara’. We have been discussing on many of these manras from Lalita Trishati. The mantras that we are going to discuss now is
Om hrīṁkāra kamalēndirāyai namaḥ
[… who is Goddess Mahalakshmi sitting on the lotus called Hrim]
Om hrīṁkāramaṇi dīpār-cciṣē namaḥ
[… who is the light of the ornamental lamp called Hrim]

“hrīṁkāra kamalēndirā” refers to Goddess Mahalakshmi who resides in a divine lotus. Lotus symbolises prosperity and Mahalakshmi represents eight kinds of prosperity. Mahalakshmi, residing in lotus, indicates completeness. Without Mahalakshmi the lotus loses its completeness. Like Lakshmi to the Lotus, Devi’s Grace completes the sadhana.

hrīṁkāramaṇi dīpār-cciṣi is the next mantra which refers to the glowing light of lamp as Devi. This lamp is a special lamp made of rare and precious gems. The radiance of these jewels brighten the light of the lamp. It is not merely a light from the lamp alone, it is also the lustre of the precious stones in the lamp. Devi is ever shining with the light of the blissful state of Brahman. The effulgence of Devi’s divine light cannot be compared to the ordinary festival lights or glowing celebrities. The glowing countenance of celebrities depends on good food, luxury, make up and attire. These celebrities have people attending to each of the aspects of grooming. This glow is perceived on coming near the person but the radiance of great Masters and Devi knows no distance. Devi’s effulgence is a manifestation of the light of the blissful state of Brahman. These two shlokas explain Devi’s ultimate form.

Om hrīṁkāra taruśārikāyai namaḥ
[… who is the lady bird sitting on the tree called Hrim]
is the next mantra. It says that Devi is the parrot living in a fruit bearing tree. Taranath Tharuhu is the Sanskrit lakshana meaning the name taru is given to tree because it protects. To get the fruits of the tree, we have to climb and atop is the parrot representing Devi.

nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalaṁ
śuka-mukhād amṛta-drava-saṁyutam
pibata bhāgavataṁ rasam ālayaṁ
muhur aho rasikā bhuvi bhāvukāḥ

O expert and thoughtful men, relish Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, the mature fruit of the desire tree of Vedic literatures. It emanated from the lips of Śrī Śukadeva. Therefore this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls.
Srimad Bhagavatam 1.1.3
13:12
Usually the fruits that are pecked by birds are considered more apt for consumption as birds won’t bite those fruits that are poisonous or has gone bad. Here the fruit has fallen from the wish fulfilling tree of Vedas and Upanishads. It is the fruit of Bhagavata. Sri Sukadeva is compared to a parrot who has tasted this fruit of Bhagavata. This mantra says to drink the essence of this fruit as much as possible. The bliss that one derives is not like the happiness one get from the materialistic objects. We will not relish sixth dosa the same way we had enjoyed the first one. This fruit of Bhagavata is entering into the very core of our being. Anybody of any age can consume it. Blessed are those people who enjoys this fruit.

Here himkara is an example. If we could compare any mantras as a tree, Devi is the bird residing in that tree depicted by the mantra hrīṁkāra taruśārikā

Om hrīṁkāra kōśāsilatāyai namaḥ is the next mantra
[… who is the shining sword in the sheath called `Hrim`]
Om hrīṁkārāsthāna nar-ttakyai namaḥ is the following mantra
[… who is the dancer in the stage called `Hrim`]

Usually, a sword kills bad people, our enemies and thus protects the good and our dear ones. This mantra means that Devi is the sword inside the cover that is Hrimkaram. Devi protects Hrimkara saadhaks (those who chant mantras). In the Phala Sruti (benefits) of Lalita Sahasranama, it says that Devi will protect those who chant just one name once. Devi helps in protecting Hrimkara Saadhaks and removing their sorrow. This mantra means that Devi is the sword inside the shield that is the sound Hrim.

The next mantra is “hrīṁkārāsthāna nar-ttaki”. Hrimkara is a hall made of gems. It is a hall decked with gems. A dancer is performing in that hall. That hall practices Hrimkara. Devi Parameshwari dances in that hall. In temples, they take stories or part of history or from Puranas and manifest them through music and musical instruments. A dancer dances to that music. She expresses Navarasas (nine types of emotions) through her eyes, hands, mudras, steps and so on. The audience enjoys those performances. Navarasas are also well enjoyed and appreciated. Enjoyment is based on the mental attitude and maturity of those who watch. At the same time, whatever character the dancer assumes: She acts as Ravan, Sri Ram, Krishna, Yashodha and so on, she knows that they are different. This hall or stage is the universe. In this universe, Devi performs actions like creation, preservation, destruction, disappearance, blessings and so on. At the same time Devi has the awareness that She is beyond this universe. The audience needs maturity. They should purify their mind through severe penance. Only those who have pure mind can enjoy Devi’s actions in the right sense. This beautiful mantra makes us understand that Devi is both the dancer and worship hall. This mantra makes us realize that we who live in this universe should be aware of the fact that. Devi is the dancer and the dance hall is the Sadhana. Devi is the source of everything and we should surrender before her.

There are sixty mantras in Lalitha Trishathi that began with the word Hrim.
The next mantra is
Om hrīṁkāra bōdhitāyai namaḥ
[… who is Hrim and Hrim is She.]
It means she who is known by the sound Hrim. We cannot separate word and meaning. When we hear a word, we right away relate it to the object it represents. We remember Parashakthi when we hear Hrim. There are four letters Hi, ru, e, um. We saw earlier that Devi is creation, preservation, destruction and beyond. Parashakti is a being whom we know.
एकम सत विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति
Ekam Sat Vipra Bahudha Vadanti
Rig Veda 1.164.146
Existence is One, Sages call it by different Names. Some say she is the power who encourages senses, few say she is the witness who shines in the hearts of beings. Ishavasya Upanishad says that God is everything. The summary is that Devi is one who is known through all these different ways. All Upanishads talk about the one substance or truth.

एकधा बहुधा चैव दृश्यते जलचन्द्रवत् ॥
ekadhā bahudhā caiva dṛśyate jalacandravat
Brahmabindūpaniṣad Verse 12
This can be described using an example. Moonlight shines in the skies. Below there are pots filled with water. Every pot seems like having moonlight. Moon light is reflected in all water bodies. There is only one substance or matter. Its reflection is seen everywhere. This is the essence of the above mantra. Even though we explain in different ways it is just one. We should realize “unity in diversity”. hrīṁkāra bōdhitā means she who is aware through Hrimkara.

The next mantra is
Om hrīṁkāramaya sauvar-ṇṇastaṁbha vidruma putrikāyai namaḥ
[… who is the coral statue on the shining pillars called `Hrim`].
A beautiful view is presented before us. There is a golden palace with golden pillars. Devi is a beautiful idol of coral situated in the most important, hidden space in this golden palace. So Hrimkara is compared to a beautiful golden palace. Chanting mantras are that valuable and precious. Chanting mantra is unavoidable for those seeking spiritual progress. Devi is the most beautiful idol, the most worshipful. Scriptures talk about strong, unshakeable devotion. They will perform rituals at dusk, at the right time, chant mantras. They will offer worship elements like water, incense, flower, camphor, food offerings and so on in the right way. Even though there is discipline in this, there may be a lack in inner feeling or expression. Liberation is not attainable for them. Inner purity is the most important attribute. For example, we visited Meenakshi Amman temple and saw its thousand mandaps, pond and other holy places. We could not have darshan of Meenakshi Devi because we were late. So there is no use. Likewise, we arrive at Vallikavu, saw the ashram, went to the beach, Kali temple but did not get darshan of Amma. It is similar to the above. The most important part of spiritual practices is to attain realization of Devi. It is enough to see Amma, a word of Amma, and look from Amma. Amma smiled, Amma spoke, Amma enquired. We cannot derive this happiness received from anything else. Devi is the beautiful coral idol located in the most important part of a golden palace.

The next mantra in Lalitha Trishati is
Om hrīṁkāra vēdōpaniṣadē namaḥ
[… who is the Upanishad placed in the top of Veda called `Hrim`].
Hrimkara is compared to Veda. Devi is the part of its Upanishad. Veda has two parts, Karma (Actions) Kandam and Jnana (Knowledge) Kandam. Karma Kandam talks about all noble knowledge necessary for worldly living. It covers dexterity in multiple languages, writing and reading them, learning and remembering, writing poetry, learning Vedas like Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, learning Upa (sub) Veda like Dhanur, Gandharva, Ayur and so on. It also covers construction, maintenance of buildings, playing musical instruments like Mridanga, Learning to dance, playing flute and other instruments, carpentry, all knowledge for our living, performing yagas and yajnas. Thus Vedas discuss all such actions in Karma Kandam.
23:36
At the same time, Vedas also discusses about the need for ultimate knowledge. This mortal frame is perishable. There is something that is unperishable and pervades in all sentient and insentient objects in the universe. All senses function with the power from this one matter. That principle is the inner witness of all. A pot is made, ten holes are drilled, one lamp is lit in it. Light is seen through all the ten holes. Our senses are like this. Supreme consciousness is the inner witness of senses. Upanishads teach us the supreme principle in various ways. This is Jnana Kandam. Upanishads teach us that liberation is attained only through the true supreme knowledge. We can realize through this mantra that even though Vedas are Hrimkara practices, they hint at the karma Kandam of Vedas and Devi tattva or principle is the knowledge behind it. Lalita Trishati teaches us ways for God realization.

The next mantra is
Om hrīṁkārādhvara dakṣiṇāyai namaḥ
[… who is like the Dakshina given to priests after Yagna which is `Hrim`]
A summarized meaning is Devi is the offering for the yaga Hrimkara. The one attribute seen in all mantras is that Devi is the most important. Devi is like an offering in a yaga. Yagas and yajnas are done as a group for the good of the society. It is not the time itself but the preparations for a yaga, purification of the place, making the stage, the pit, gathering homa materials in a purified atmosphere, rituals done prior to homa, priests, disciplined life led by them with spiritual practices, their purification – all these lead to the fruitful completion of a yaga. All these days, we were listening to the important sections, names of Lalitha Sahasranama. Let us continue in the following days.

The next mantra is
Om hrīṁkārādhvara dakṣiṇāyai namaḥ
[… who is like the Dakshina given to priests after Yagna which is `Hrim`]

A summarized meaning is Devi is the offering for the yaga Hrimkara. Devi is like an offering in a yaga. It is not the time itself but the preparations for a yaga, purification of the place, making the stage, the pit, gathering homa materials in a purified atmosphere, rituals done prior to homa, priests, disciplined life led by them with spiritual practices, Their purification – all these lead to the fruitful completion of a yaga. The owner has the yaga performed for the benefit of the society. For that, the owner gets the space ready, gathers all elements, brings people and prepares for their stay and see to it that they are comfortable. The priests involve themselves in the yagas with total focus and pure intention and resolve. In yagas, we offer liquids, rice and so on, they are called havis. Donation or Dakshina (offering) is the remuneration the priests get from the owner when a yaga is performed successfully. Clothes and food are distributed. To those who partake in that which is called annadaan or vastradaan. Bhiksha is given to those who are outside the yagashala or the tenet where the yaga is performed. As an appreciation, gold, clothes, grains, money and so on are given as Dakshina to the priests who perform the yagas by the owner, according to his ability. Yaga karma includes all this.

In Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavan Sri Krishna says
मन्त्रहीनमदक्षिणम्
mantra-hīnam adakṣhiṇam
Gita 17.13

It means that yaga is incomplete if mantras are not chanted properly and also dakshina is not properly given. Dakshina should not be demanded. The owner donates according to his capability to those who perform yagas for the benefit of the society. Dakshina indicates the perfection of the yaga. The perfection of the spiritual practice of Hrimkara is in the realization of Devi, in seeing Devi. This mantra teaches us that the goal of any mantra chanting, Hrimkara yaga is realizing Devi.

The next mantra is
Om hrīṁkāra nandanārāma navakalpaka vallaryai namaḥ
[… who is the divine climber Kalpa present in the garden called `Hrim`].

Devi is the vine of flowers in the Hrimkara Nandana forest. Hrimkara is compared here to a garden in the world of Indra. There is a huge garden. There are rows and rows of beautiful trees, flowering plants, verities of vines, ponds and so on. In the midst of this natural beauty is the most beautiful tree. That is the Kalpaka tree (wish fulfilling tree). This tree fulfills the desire of all. That Kalpaka tree has the most important position in that Nandana forest. People go there to rest and relax. Those who suffer in their worldly engagements visit a garden to relax. They walk around the garden and view the beautiful sights. They find joy in that. Their happiness is doubled when they are beneath the most beautiful tree. Devi is such a wish fulfilling Kalpaka tree. Hrimkara mantra imbibes creation, preservation, destruction and the consciousness beyond. We receive objects we wish for. Worship this mantra fulfils righteousness, wealth, desire and liberation. The most important is attaining Devi’s grace. We are seeing the narration of a mantra Hrimkaryai Namah from Lalita Sahasranama. Lalita Trishati describes this in sixty mantras. “hrīṁkāra himaval-ggaṁgā”, “hrīṁkārār-ṇṇava kaustubhā” are the next two mantras. Devi is Ganga of Hrimkara Himalaya. Devi is the gem of the milky ocean of Hrimkara. All these days, we were listening to the important sections, names of Lalita Sahasranama and their explanations. Let us continue in the following days.

Om hrīṁkāra himaval-ggaṁgāyai namaḥ
[… who is the river Ganga in the Himalayan mountain called `Hrim`]
Om hrīṁkārār-ṇṇava kaustubhāyai namaḥ
[… who is the kausthuba jewel (a precious gem) of the ocean called `Hrim`]
are the next two mantras. Devi is the Ganga of Hrimkara Himalaya. Devi is the kaustubha gem in the milky ocean of Hrimkara. Ganga river is very famous. Ganga is the most important river in the Himalayas. Ganga is the union of several rivers known under different names. Ganga is the pride of India. The river is about 2500 kilometers long. Its average depth is 52 feet. Its deepest measures to hundred feet where even ships sail. It is said that six percent of the world population uses this river. Not only humans but many animals like lion and tiger depend on Ganga. Many regions from India to Bangladesh flourish due to Ganga. Great souls are compared to Ganga. Some bathe in it. Some row boats across Ganga, many drink its water. The water is used for worship, many use it for agriculture. It does not differentiate between Hindus, Muslims, Christians, humans or animals. Everybody uses it. People on one shore bathe in it whereas another groups drinks from it. Orders of spiritual practices are also like that. All religions are in search of one truth. Ganga is the most integral part of the Himalayas. Importance is only for Ganga. Significance of Hrimkara mantra is to realize Devi like Ganga river. This is the summary of the first mantra. “hrīṁkārār-ṇṇava kaustubhā” Devas and demons churned the Milky ocean. Many miracles happened. The wish fulfilling Klapaka tree, horse named Uchaishravas. Many invaluable objects originated from it. It is said that fourteen thousand gems came out of it. The most important among all the gems is Kaustubha. Aishwarya Lakshmi (Lakshmi representing auspiciousness, prosperity) resides wherever Kaustuba is present. Seeing the beauty of Kaustubh, Maha Vishnu wore it. Maha Vishnu is he (the one
) who wears Kaustubh. All eight auspiciousness is present where Maha Vishnu is present. Kaustubh gem is the most valuable of all gems that originated from the Milky Ocean. Both this mantra indicate that Devi is the most important like Ganga in the Himalayas and Kaustubh gem from the Milky Ocean.

Following the main sections of Lalitha Sahasranama, there will be explanation of each name. We covered Devi as embodiment of the temple (that is the body), supreme consciousness, the five actions – creation, preservation, destruction, disappearance, blessing, followed by Vedas, Agamas, their significance, importance of chanting and worshiping of Hrimkara mantra, of spiritual practices. Vedas and Upanishads teach us Brahmaiva bhavati, that is union of Paramatma the supreme consciousness and Jivatma the living being. All practices and ritualistic orders are for this purpose. Supreme Consciousness cannot be realized through senses. It cannot be seen with eyes, heard with ears, tasted by tongue, touched by skin. It cannot be realized through senses. Hence it is called Avyakta, that which is unclear. It becomes clear through own experience. We attain the goal when we realize the self. But this is impossible right away. Our mind gets purified through devotion for Devi who is the embodiment of supreme consciousness. Devi is within us. “Aham Ityeva Vibhavaye Maheshi”. Sri Vidya Upasana is a worship wherein we realize the Devi and I are one and the same. By visualizing that I and Devi whom we worship are the same, we get firmly established in our beliefs. Self-realization, goal of life is becoming aware that I and Devi are one. But this does not happen right away. In the beginning, we have limited devotion. In the early stages, we are ignorant of its order. At the same time, we lack in total devotion. Some acquire that knowledge as soon as they hear words of Guru. Many others do not get that. Some others take many births to attain that perfection. Total devotion occurs through many lifetimes of Sadhana because of latent tendencies and lack of pure mind. Some of us have limited devotion which is coming from just the throat. Some may think it out with their mind. Some liberated souls are aware that Devi’s form and knowledge are one. Devi leads us towards that goal by encouraging and inspiring us forgiving our short comings, by loving us. So Devi leads us again through the path of devotion.


Om paśu pāśa vimocinyai namaḥ
[who releases the ignorant from bondage.]
is a mantra that indicates the above. Everybody is entangled in attachment. Jiva is entangled in attachment. Siddha is liberated from all bondage. A very simple meaning for pasham is attachment to panam and ashanam. Panam is drinking and Ashanam is eating. Humans are tied to such desires and animosity. The way we tie a cow with a rope, the same way we are tied with such emotions and feelings. There are other sorrows also like wrong knowledge, asmita, desire, animosity zealous and so on. Avidya means wrong knowledge. We see all pervading consciousness limited to a small body. We see it contained in body, mind, intellect and senses. That is called avidya. Avidya is another word for ajanana or ignorance. Aspita means feeling of I see, I hear, I touch, I experience, I eat and so on. Asmi means the feeling of I exist. Asmita is the feeling that I am the body. Ragam is extreme desire or obsession to acquire an object. Dwesham is the emotion we have when we donot get that. Abhinivesh is that zealous to somehow acquire that. Generally, Pasham is the seven emotions like panam, ashamanam, avidya, asmita, ragam, dwesham, abhinivesham. These emotions have tied us to this universe just like animals are tied up with chains. These seven emotions or ropes have tied us up. The mantra ‘paśu pāśa vimocini’ means that Devi releases us from this bondage of desires. All these days, we were listening to the important sections, name of Lalitha Sahasranama and their explanations. Let us continue in the following days.

We saw the form of the Devata Dakini in the Yogini Nyasa. We must remember that all these descriptions start with the Chakra of the presiding deity. The initial mantra was
Om viśuddhi cakra nilayāyai namaḥ
[who resides in the Visuddhi chakra.]

the description of the devata “Rakini” starts with the Anahatha Chakra. “anāhatābja nilayā- śyāmābhā- vadana dvayā- daṁṣṭrojjvalā- akṣa mālādi dharā- rudhira saṁsthitā- kāla rātryādi śaktyaugha vṛtā- snigdhaudana priyā- mahā vīrendra varadā- rākiṇyambā svarūpiṇi”
These mantras describe the attributes of Rakini Devi. The mantra starts with the Anahatha Chakra.
Om anāhatābja nilayāyai namaḥ
[who resides in the anahata lotus in the heart.]
Om śyāmābhāyai namaḥ
[who is black in complexion.]
Om vadana dvayāyai namaḥ
[who has two faces.]
Om daṁṣṭrojjvalāyai namaḥ
[who has shining tusks.]
Om akṣa mālādi dharāyai namaḥ
[who is wearing garlands of rudraksa beads and other things.]
Om rudhira saṁsthitāyai namaḥ
[who presides over the blood in the bodies of living beings.]
Om kāla rātryādi śaktyaugha vṛtāyai namaḥ
[who is surrounded by Kalaratri and other shaktis.]
Om snigdhaudana priyāyai namaḥ
[who is fond of food offerings containing ghee, oil, and other fats.]
Om mahā vīrendra varadāyai namaḥ
[who bestows boons on great warriors.]
Om rākiṇyambā svarūpiṇyai namaḥ
[who is in the form of Mother Rakini described in the nine previous names.]
This is the title that we are listening to, as part of the Yogini Nyasam. We have listed out the names of the seven Yoginis. We heard the descriptions of the two devatas Dakini and Rakini. Dakini resides in the Visuddhichakra and we saw that Rakinidevi resides in the Anahathabjam. Dakini Devi is the deity of the organ of touch, Rakini Devi presides over the blood of all living beings.

Now we come to the description of the third goddess.
maṇipūrābja nilayā- vadana traya samyutā- vajrādikāyudhopetā- ḍāmaryādibhir āvṛtā- rakta varṇā- māṁsa niṣṭhā- guḍānna prīta mānasā- samasta bhakta sukhadā- lākinyambā svarūpiṇi
We are listening to the attributes of Devi Lakini. Devi Lakini resides in the Lotus with ten petals in the Manipuraka Chakra. She has 3 faces. She holds the Vajra (lightning bolt) and other weapons. She is escorted by Damari and other attending deities. She is red in complexion. She presides over the flesh in all living beings. She is fond of dishes made with jaggery. Lakini Devi confers Happiness on all her devotees. Thus we can see the beautiful description of Lakini Devi.

The goddess that we are going to describe next is Kakini Devi. The description of each goddess starts with the Aadharchakra (energy centres). The attribute of Dakini Devi first described is “viśuddhi cakra nilayā”. The attribute of Rakini Devi first described is “anāhatābja nilayā”. The attribute of Lakini Devi first described is “maṇipūrābja nilayā”. She has three faces. She holds the Vajra (Lightning bolt) and other weapons. She is escorted by Damari and others attending deities. She is red in complexion. She presides over the flesh in all living beings. She is fond of dish made with jaggery. Lakini Devi confers happiness on all her devotees. The names of three of the seven Devis are given above.

We are now starting upon the description of Devi Kakini. It starts with her Aadara chakra, the “The Swadhistanam”. “svādhiṣṭhānāmbuja gatā- catur vaktra manoharā- śūlādyāyudha sampannā- pīta varṇā- ati garvitā- medo niṣṭhā- madhu prītā- bandhinyādi samanvitā- dadhyannāsakta hṛdayā- kākinī rūpa dhāriṇi” Devi resides in the Swadhishtana Chakra on a lotus with six petals. She has four beautiful faces. (The Vedas). Who possesses the trident noose, skull and other weapons. She is Yellow in complexion. She takes pride in her weapons and in her captivating beauty. She resides in the fat in all living beings. She is fond of honey and other intoxicants. She is accompanied by Bandhini and other Shakthis. She is particularly fond of offering made with curd. She is named as Kakini Devi.
01:51
The name of the next Devi in the shadanganyasam is Sakini. “mūlādhārāmbujārūḍhā- pañca vaktrā- asthi saṁsthitā- aṅkuśādi praharaṇā- varadādi niṣevitā- mudgaudanāsakta cittā- sākinyambā svarūpiṇi”
The name of this deity is Sakini. We started with Vishuddhi chakra, then moved on to Anahatham, Manipurabjam, Swadhishtanam and now we have reached the muladharam. The chakras are depicted from top to bottom, in the descending order. Sakini Devi resides in the lotus in the Muladhara chakra. She has five faces. (four directions and skywards). She resides in the bones. She holds the goad and other weapons. She is the bestower of blessings, accompanied by varada and and other devotees. She is very fond of food offerings made with green gram. Her name is Sakini Devi. We started Vishuddhi Chakra, moved on to Anahatham, Mani purabjam, Swadhishtanam, and the Muladharam. The skin, the elements, of blood, flesh, fat and bones in which they reside have also been described. I have tried to explain the Lalitha Sahasranamam in a manner understandable to everybody. It has been divided into many sections and each section will be explained. We shall hear more about this in the coming episodes.

Devi Hakini is being described in the next six mantras. “ājñā cakrābja nilayā- śukla varṇā- ṣaḍ ānanā- majjā saṁsthā- haṁsa vatī mukhya śakti samanvitā- haridrānnaika rasikā- hākinī rūpa dhāriṇi” (521-52). Hakini Devi resides in the Ajna chakra on the lotus with two petals. She is fair white in colour. She has six face (Six Shastras). She is the presiding deity of the bone marrow. She is accompanied by Hamsavathi and other Shakthis. She is fond of offerings seasoned with turmeric, like yellow rice. She wears the form of Hakini.

Now we come to the description of Devi Yakini, who is seated on the lotus with a thousand petals. “sahasra dala padmasthā- sarva varṇopaśobhitā- sarvāyudha dharā- śukla saṁsthitā- sarvatomukhi- sarvaudana prīta cittā- yākinyambā svarūpiṇi” (528-535) Her abode is the lotus with a thousand petals. She is radiant and resplendent in many colours. She holds all the countless weapons in her countless hands. She resides in the Semen. She has face turned in all directions. She is pleased by all offerings of food. She is in the form of Yakini Yogini. We started with Vishuddhi chakra, moved on to Anahatha, Manipuraka, Swadhishtana and the Mooladhara. Then we described the Yoginis residing in the Ajna chakra and the Sahasrara. We described the seven yoginis in the order of Dakini, Rakini, Lakini, Kakini, Sakini, Hakini and Yakini. We described the numerous weapons they hold, their faces, their attending Shaktis. This is called the Devi Shadanganyasam. This is very important for conducting puja. From mantra 475 to 534, we see the description of the Devi Shadanganyasam. This portion of the Lalitha Sahasranama is very important for kundalini worshippers. With the description of the mantra “pañcāśat pīṭha rūpiṇi” (883) the portions dealing with Sadanganyasa is completed. “ganesha, (Lord Ganesha) graha, (nine planets) nakshathra, (27 stars) yogini, (seven yoginis) rashi rupini (12 zodiac signs), devi peethamayim vande” are all invoked in specific parts of the body. This is called Sadanganyasa. With the description of the “Devi Peethams” the Shadanganyasa which come under the title of “Yogini-nyasam” is explained. With this mantra “pañcāśat pīṭha rūpiṇi” a very important section of the Lalitha Sahasranama has been completed.
21:12
The mantra that comes after, “svāhā – svadhā – matir – medhā – śruti - smṛti – anuttamā - puṇya kīrti - puṇya labhyā” leading up to the last two mantras “śiva śaktyaikya rūpiṇi – lalitāmbikā”. The last two mantras are “śiva śaktyaikya rūpiṇi – lalitāmbikā” It shows the Shivashakti samarasyam, which is the inseparable connection of Shiva and Shakti. The kundalini awakens and attains Shiva. The kundalini and Shiva becomes one, inseparably connected. This section on the Shivashakthi Samarasyam is given in two mantras. From 535 to 988 comes the next important section of the Lalitha Sahasranama. It is called “Vibhuthi Vistaara Yogam”. We cannot consider this to be a very definite title. These mantras describe the infinite glory of Devi, the many forms in which she pervades the universe. We cannot say that each mantra is connected to the other. Together, they are called “Vibhuthi Vistaara Yogam, prakaranam” etc. (A description of the infinite glorious attributes of Devi). The last title is called “Shiva Shakti Samarasyam”. So far, we have seen many of the important titles or subdivisions of the Lalitha Sahasranama in order to familiarize ourselves. We learnt that Devi is born out of “cid agni kuṇḍa”, the fire pit of pure consciousness. “deva kārya samudyatā” – she is intent on fulfilling and protecting the needs of the Devas”. We learnt about the origin of Devi from the fire pit of pure consciousness. We saw how she had both the rope of love and the goad of anger in her hands. We are enthralled by the description on her beautiful physical form. “campakāśoka punnāga saugandhika lasat kacā” – we listened to the glorious descriptions of her beauty from head to toe. “maṇḍita śrī padāmbujā” - We listened to the city in which Devi resided “Sri Nagaram”. “devarṣi gaṇa saṅghāta stūyamānātma vaibhavā”, “bhaṇḍāsura vadhodyukta śakti senā samanvitā” – (65) – These mantras describe the valour and might of the Devi. She was born to slay the demon Bhandasura. She slew him. “kāmeśvarāstra nirdagdha sabhaṇḍāsura śūnyakā” – (82), “brahmopendra mahendrādi deva saṁstuta vaibhavā” – (83). We heard about the mantras in which her courage and skill in warfare is praised by all the gods. Then we heard about her names like “mūla mantrātmikā, mūla kūṭa traya kalebarā”. (88-89) “kulāmṛtaika rasikā” – (90) we heard the description of her mantra swaroopam. We listened to the section of the mantras which described her as the kundalini. “mahā sakti - kuṇḍalini” – (109, 110)- She who is the inseparable union of Shiva and Shakti. We saw the importance of devotion in the mantras. “bhavāni – bhāvanāgamyā - bhavāraṇya kuṭhārikā - bhadra priyā - bhadra mūrt” (112-116) “nir guṇā - niṣ kalā – śāntā - niṣ kāmā - nir upaplavā” (139-143). We saw the mantras which described the formless attributes of Devi like “mahā tantrā - mahā mantra - mahā yantrā – mahāsanā” (226 – 229). These mantras denote that there is nothing greater than Devi. “mahā catuḥ ṣaṣṭi koṭi yoginī gaṇa sevitā” – (237). The importance of Devotion is shown in the mantras “catuḥ ṣaṣtyupacārāḍhyā” (235)- Who is adored in 64 ceremonies. The mantras where Devi shines resplendent in temples. She is the great temple and her divinity pervades the entire universe. She has her abode in the heart of each one of us. The mantras in which she is praised as the one who shines within the Nigamas and the Agamas (collection of scriptures). To take care of and protect the humans she had created, Devi laid down the Vedas, The Upavedas, Dharmashastras and Ithihasas. She is the one who uplifts society to live with the right values told through the Puranas. “varṇāśrama vidhāyini” – (286) She who guides everybody to the proper path through the four varnas and four ashramas, the social divisions in life. I have tried to explain the Lalitha Sahasranama in a manner understandable to everybody. It has been divided into many sections and each section will be explained. We shall hear more about this in the coming episodes.

Devi creates, preserves, annihilates, and recreates the universe through Brahma, Vishnu, Maheshwara, Iswara & Sadashiva. We learned about the importance of worship by chanting mantras and their procedural aspects. We saw through many beautiful examples the attitude one should have when we chant the mantras. We discussed the six-part worship named Sadanganyasam. We also learned how Devi frees the ignorant from the bondage of happiness and sorrow or the cycle of birth and rebirth. From now onwards, we can look into the mantras starting from Swaha, Swadha, Matirmedha, (Lalita Sahasranama 135) till the end we see the description and celebration of the infinite glory of Devi. Then we could see the inseparable connection between Shiva & Shakti. There can be further classifications of Lalita Sahasranama, but we are not venturing into that many details for now. What we are trying to achieve is to get a bird's eye view of the contents of Sri Lalita Sahasranama.

Now we are going to take each mantra and explain it based on the commentary of Bhaskararaya named "Saubhagyabhaskaram". There are many Sahasranamas namely Ganga, Bhavani, Gayatri, Kali, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Rajeswari, Bala, Syamala are all celebrating Devi. We also have 1000 names of Vishnu, Shiva, Ganesha, and other deities as well. Not many know the in-depth meanings of the mantras. People recite the Sahasranamas because they feel indescribable joy when they chant the mantras with devotion and the musical cadence of the chants calm their mind.

yatrāsti bhogo na ca tatra mojho yatrāsti bhoge na ca tatra bhoga:.
śrīsundarīsevanatatparānāṃ, bhogaśca mokṣaśca karastha eva.
Paramakshara Sutram
It is the principle that where there is bhoga (worldly pleasure) there is no moksha (enlightenment) and where there is moksha there is no bhoga. But the worshipers of Devi Tripurasundari beholds bhoga in one hand and moksha in the other.

Usually, people consider the spiritual path to be completely separate from worldly life. The spiritual seeker feels that he has to stay away from the business of the world. But the devotees of Devi are quite different. The Shakta religion teaches us that they should live graciously with sweet words and wealth. Moksha and Bhoga do not usually stand together. In a commentary on the Lalita Sahasranama for the mantra (32)

"ratna graiveya cintāka lola muktā phalānvitā".

The commentary describes three types of seekers.
Graiveya chintakas, lola chintakas and mukta chintakas. Graiveya chintakas are those who worship Her and are satisfied with loud prayers. Lola chintakas waver from one to the other, from a worldly life to spiritual life and vice-versa. Mukta chintakas have ultimate liberation as their only goal. Devi wears all three kinds of devotees as an ornament around her neck. In Bhagavad Gita, Lord says about 4 types of devotees.

chatur-vidhā bhajante māṁ janāḥ sukṛitino ’rjuna
ārto jijñāsur arthārthī jñānī cha bharatarṣhabha
Gita 7.16
Four kinds of pious people engage in My devotion—the distressed, the seekers of knowledge, the seekers of worldly possessions, and those who are situated in knowledge.

udārāḥ sarva evaite jñānī tvātmaiva me matam
Gita 7.18
All those who are devoted to Me are indeed noble.
16:37
The Lord considers all four to be meritorious people. Initially, we might not pray for the sake of devotion. We might pray to fulfill a desire, to be cured of sickness, or to get a job promotion. Many pray with some motive or desire to be fulfilled. There is a system in India known as Ananta Sahasranamam otherwise known as Ayuta Sahasranamam. There are 10,000 mantras in it. It is dedicated to Lord Siva. It takes hours to complete the chanting. The time that we take to chant depends on our devotion, our job, and the time that we have at our disposal. We can immerse ourselves in the joy of the Lord's names, for as long as we want to. There are people who chant Lalita Sahasranama at the temples from dawn to dusk, the time from the temple door opens till it closes just by having only the prasad they get from the temple to appease their hunger. This is known as Bhajanam. In Lalita Sahasranama, it is described as

pratipan mukhya rākānta tithi maṇḍala pūjitā (610)
who is worshipped daily starting with pratipada (first day of the lunar half month) and ending with the full moon

First Lalita Sahasranama is chanted 10 times, then the number is increasing slowly then decreased, and then increased. There is a particular order known as Purascharanam. Some people chant it 108 times. Some people chant it 300 times up to 1000 times. It is believed that the closest devotees of the Mother like Brahma, Vishnu & Maheshwara are ceaselessly chanting the Lalita Sahasranama. Even though we start chanting the Lalita Sahasranama as a means to fulfill our desires, gradually the attitude behind our chanting will be transformed to one of pure devotion and love for the Mother. Like Yashoda, Meera, Andaal, we will start chanting the mantras out of pure love and become the epitome of devotion. The ordinary devotee will become the ideal one and later the ideal one gets transformed into such epitomes of devotion and gradually attain the ultimate goal of self-realization. For such people, this is a resting place. For people like us, they are like sacred steps towards that glorious goal. For mahatmas like Amma, chanting mantras are not a spiritual practice but a mode or place of rest. Let us climb the sacred steps one by one and become worthy of the blessings of Amma.

We will begin with mantra number one and go on explaining each mantras from the next episode onwards

Lalita Sahasranama
https://youtu.be/AhrbP4tbd6w
12:02
My humble pranams to the audience. In the preceding days, we have heard a very miniature commentary on the important themes and topics of the Lalita Sahasranama. We had discussed the meaning of many important mantras. So far this commentary has helped us to gain a bird's eye view of the meaning of the mantras of Lalita Sahasranama. From today onwards we will start to explain in detail the meanings of each mantra of the Lalita Sahasranama. There around 320 verses (slokas) in the Lalita Sahasranama. Each part has been imparted to particular persons and here we shall learn about the genesis and the beginning of the practice of worshipping Devi by chanting the 1000 names. This information is contained in the initial preface of 51 verses. All of us know the middle part. These are the regularly chanted 1000 names starting from Sri Mata ... to Lalitambika. This part contains 182 verses. Then comes the tail end knowns as Phala Sruti or the statement of benefits of chanting Lalita Sahasranama. It contains 85 verses. Before we chant the Lalita Sahasranama, we start with the hymn of meditation known as Dhyana Sloka. The meditation verses start with Om Sindūrāruṇa vigrahām trinayanām..... Some devotees chant only one hymn while others chant all the 4 hymns of the Dhyana Sloka. So the Lalita Sahasranama is classified into
⦿ Initial Phase - 51 verses (Prelude to Lalita Sahasranama including Dhyana Sloka)
⦿ Middle Phase - 182 verses (Stotra - 100 Names)
⦿ Final Phase - 85 verses (Phala Sruti)
This is the form of Lalita Sahasranama as a whole.

There are 3 very famous Sahasranamas. Ganesha Sahasranama (taken from Ganesha Purana), the Vishnu Sahasranama (taken from the Mahabharata) and the Lalita Sahasranama (taken from Brahmanda Purana). There are profound commentaries for all these three Sahasranamas. Bhaskararaya has written a commentary on the Ganesha Sahasranama & Lalita Sahasranama. Adi Sankara wrote a commentary for the Vishnu Sahasranama. All these three are chanted all the world even today. We would have heard that the Vishnu Sahasranama starts with the meditation verse
śuklāmbaradharaṃ viṣṇuṃ śaśivarṇaṃ caturbhujam .
prasannavadanaṃ dhyāyet sarvavighnopaśāntaye
The stotram is chanted after the initial part is recited, then we chant the Phala Sruti. Vishnu Sahasranama is comparatively smaller. It can be chanted quickly. It could be that with the passage of time, we no longer chant the stotram in its complete form. In our Ashram we chant the Namavali. the one verse,

śrī mātā - śrī mahā rājñi - śrīmat siṁhāsaneśvari is split into 3 separate mantras with a prefix of Aum and suffix of Namah like
Om śrī mātre namaḥ
Om śrī mahā rājñyai namaḥ
Om śrīmat siṁhāsaneśvaryai namaḥ
This type of chanting is known as Namavali

We have heard about the incarnation of Lord Vishnu as Vamana. Vamana came in the form of a small Brahmin boy and asked for alms. When Mahabali tried to grant him his request, Vamana grows into Trivikrama encompassing the entire universe. A huge banyan tree sprouts from a minute seed. In a similar way, each word of the Lalita Sahasranama is a mantra. Mantra means "that upon which we should reflect upon continuously"
mananāt trāyatē iti mantrah

The Guru advises us "You and God are one." "The individual self and the cosmic self, the supreme principle are not different from each other, they are one." But we are unable to experience this knowledge. We are plagued by many doubts. In order to get rid of our doubts, we must repeatedly read and ponder upon the scriptures. The mantras of Lalita Sahasranama are ideal for practicing continuous reflection. As I have said before, the Lalita Sahasranama is from the Brahmanda Purana. There are eighteen puranas.
Matsyam, Kurmam, Varaham, Lingam, Shaivam, Brahmam, Skandam, Brahmandam, Naradam, Bhagavatam, Padmam, Agni, Brahmavaivartam, Bhavishyam, Markandeyam, Vishnu, Vamanam & Garudam.
12:02
Lalita Sahasranama can be found in the last canto of the Brahmanda Purana. It is part of the chapter known as Lalitopakhyanam. There are seven parts to it called the mantra kandam, nysasa kandam, puja kandam, purascharana kandam, homa kandam, rahasya kandam and stotra kandam. Mantra kanda deals. upon the topic of mantras - What are mantras, the correct method of chanting, how to get initiated (diksha) with a mantra, the continuous chanting and reflection on the mantra after receiving it from the Guru etc. Nyasa kandam teaches how to become aware of the presence of God in each and every part of the body, we touch each part of the body and meditate upon a corresponding Devata to invoke the presence of God. Puja kandam teaches us about the rules of worship, the Puja. Puraschara kandam talks about the number of times one should repeat a mantra based on the mantra that one is initiated with. Articles worth one-tenth of that count to be given for fire oblations, another one-tenth of that count to be given to feed the poor, etc are dealt in this part. Homa kanda teaches us the rules for performing homas, ritual offerings to the God of fire. The description of the gross, subtle, and supreme nature of Devi can be found in the rahasya kandam. Stotra kandam, the 7th part is where we can find the Lalita Sahasranama.

Devi is worshipped in 3 ways classified into Agni (Fire), Soma (Moon), and Surya (Sun). Each of these is subclassified into 12.
Laita Sahasranama is considered to be a worship of Devi in the Surya Kala. The 12 Surya Kalas being 1.Thapini, 2.Thaapini, 3.Dhumra, 4.Marichi, 5.Jwalini, 6.Ruchi, 7.Sushumna, 8.Bhogatha, 9.Viswa, 10.Bhodini, 11.Dharnin & 12.Kshama.

Lalita Sahasranama is classified into 12 sections (kala) by the commentator Bhaskararaya. The initial phase of 51 verses is considered as 1 Kala. The middle phase of 1000 names is divided into 10 Kalas, 100 mantras each, and the final phase of Phala Sruti as the last Kala. Devi is the abode of endless auspiciousness and the devotee who worships Her will be granted all auspiciousness. We couldn't see anything in pitch dark, but when the sun (Bhaskara) comes up, all is revealed. In the same way, the one that reveals auspiciousness (Saubhaghya) is the commentary of Lalita Sahasranama, hence it is known as Saubhagya Bhaskaram. We are hearing the explanation of the initial phase (Purva Bhaga).

It was Lord Hayagriva who revealed this auspicious Lalita Sahasranama to sage Agastya. Agastya beseeched Lord Hayagriva and to the plea of the sage, Lord consents to reveal the mantras. This is the preface to the initial phase. As said earlier, there are 51 verses in the purva bhaga (initial phase). We are going to hear a detailed explanation of these verses. Sage Agastya, eager to hear the principles of Devi, had requested this knowledge to be revealed to him states the Brahmanda Purana. Before delving into this chapter we need to know who is Hayagriva (the Guru) and Agastya (the Shishya). Once upon a time, the Devas conducted a huge yaga, ritual sacrifice. Lord Vishnu himself took charge as the protector of this sacrifice. The ritual continued for many years. As the sacrifice was coming to an end, Lord Vishnu rested his head on a bow and slept for a while. In order to awaken the Lord from his sleep, the king of Gods, Indra, took the form of an ant and gnawed and broke the bowstring. Indra did this thinking the Lord will be awakened but unfortunately, the head of the Lord was separated from the body by the force with which the bowstring broke and it flew away and disappeared. The Devas were horrified. They had only wanted to awaken the Lord. They prayed to Devi for a solution. The Mother asked to get any head that was seen nearby and place it on the body of Lord Vishnu. Devas searched and found the head of a horse that was placed on top of the body of the Lord. Thus came the incarnation of Lord Vishnu, named Hayagriva. Haya means horse. In the same manner that the Shaivas (Devotees of Lord Shiva) consider Lord Dakshinamurthy as the embodiment of knowledge, the same way the Vaishnavas (Devotees of Lord Vishnu) consider Hayagriva as the incarnation of supreme knowledge. Lord Hayagriva got two disciples, Lopamudra & Agastya. This is how the purva bhaga of Lalita Sahasranama begins.

Sage Agastya is seeking answers from his Guru, Lord Hayagriva.

agastya uvāca -
aśvānana mahābuddhe sarvaśāstraviśārada .
kathitaṃ lalitādevyāḥ caritaṃ paramādbhutaṃ .. 1..
Oh! Horse faced, wise & the learner of all Shastras, you had told me the history of Lalith Devi, which was very blissful & miraculous!!

pūrvaṃ prādurbhavo mātuḥ tataḥ paṭṭābhiṣecanaṃ .
bhaṇḍāsuravadhaścaiva vistareṇa tvacoditaḥ .. 2..
First, you'd told me about the birth of Mata & then about her crowning. Then we also saw her destruction of the demon Bhandasura elaborately.

varṇitaṃ śrīpuraṃ cāpi mahāvibhavavistaraṃ .
śrīmatpañcadaśākṣaryāḥ mahimā varṇitastathā .. 3..
Then you described Sripuram, which is Mother's divine abode & also the significance & greatness of the fifteen-lettered syllable of Sri Mata the Pancha Dashakshari.

Sage Agastya is asking Lord Hayagriva.

"Oh my Lord! Thou art the knower, firmly established in your intelligence. You are the master of all scriptures. I beseech you to reveal to me the incomparable and glorious life of Sri Lalita Devi." "You had narrated earlier that Mother was born in the fire pit of pure consciousness, She was the slayer of the evil Bhandasura, the Devas sang Her praises. She was enthroned, the magnificence of Her abode Sri Puram were all detailed to me by you. You had explained to me the immense significance of the Pancha Dashakshari Mantra. You have also instructed me on the "Shadanganyasas" (Worshiping Devi with 6 parts of the body) in the Nyasa Kandam. You have explained to me the Antaryaga - them method of inner worship of the 7 adhaara chakras. Bahiryaga means the method of outer worship starting with the preparation of a fire pit. You have taught me all the necessary steps needed to perform a mahayaga in the Puja Kandam. In the Purashcarana Kandam, you had explained in great detail the mantra and how to chant it. In the Homa Kanda, you taught me about the various oblations that have to be offered to the fire and the rules thereof. In the Rahasya Kanda, you revealed to me the mystery of the Sri Chakra, The Guru, Ishwari (The Goddess), and the Sadhaka and their oneness. You have revealed to me the subtle forms, then the gross physical forms, the subtle mantra, the spiritual practices to be undertaken, the subtlest truth of the oneness of the individual self (Jivatma), and the supreme self (Paramatma). In the Stotra Kand, you have taught me about the Sahasranamas of Mantrini and Dandini Devis. But you have forgotten one thing. You have not revealed the Lalita Sahasranama to me. YOu have explained everything else in great detail except Lalita Sahasranama."

Sage Agastya is thinking to himself, "My Guru is all-knowing. He owns all the wisdom and knowledge of all scriptures. He is the most ideal Guru for any disciple. It could be that I am not a fit vessel. I might not be deserving to be instructed on the Lalita Sahasranama." A perfect or ideal disciple should be able to perform the wishes of the Guru even before he thinks about it. The disciple of medium quality is the one who performs the wishes of the Guru after the Guru conveys it. The disciple of low quality is those who fail to act on the instructions of the Guru even after the Guru conveys it. Agasthya thinks to himself, "I have always been a perfect and an ideal disciple. I have always known and fulfilled his wishes even before he uttered them. Not only that, I know that once a Guru accepts a disciple, they will never abandon them. My Master has accepted me. Even if I am not worthy, when I receive his blessings, I will become worthy. Therefore it is not right of me to think that I am unworthy to know it. My Master has revealed everything else to me except the Lalita Sahasranama. I know not the reason"

Sage Agastya has pleaded to Lord Jayagriva many years in this way, praying to reveal the Lalita Sahasranama as stated in the initial verses of the purva bhaga.

Devi is called aneka koṭi brahmāṇḍa Janani
[who is the creator of many millions of worlds]
We are aware of only one universe. But Devi is the mother of millions of universes. Many millions of Brahmas, Vishnus, Devas, humans, Siddhas gathered before the Devi. Humans were present. Siddhas are humans who have attained self-realization. All Devas were also there. Vagdevis like Vaishini chanted this wondrous stotra before them. Devi was very pleased with that. In this latter part, we can see the words of Devi after she is pleased and happy.
tataḥ provāca lalitā sadasyān devatāgaṇān .
mamājñayaiva vāgdevyaścakruḥ stotramānu'ttamaṃ .. 41..
aṅkitaṃ nāmabhirdivyairmama prītividhāyakaiḥ .

Devi talks about the qualities of the stuti.

idaṃ nāmasahasraṃ me yo. bhaktaḥ paṭhate sakṛt .
sa me priyatamo jñeyastasmai kāmāndadāmyahaṃ .

One who chants this one is dear to me. He is most liked by me. I will fulfil all his desires. There is nothing more dear to me than the one who does Sri Chakra Puja, chants Panchadashakshari, worships with devotion, chants this 1000 names with devotion. He will have all his wishes fulfilled. This Sahasranama Stotra should be chanted all the time, advised Devi. It says that devas like Brahma Chanted Lalita Sahasranama even at midnight. They are always remembering the meaning of this stotra. They are always praising Devi with words. There is no other worship that is more pleasing to Devi. In the latter part, it mentions that even if daily rituals are not done for Devi, even if nothing else is done, this Sahasranama should be chanted regularly without fail. Hayagriva Deva says this to Sage Agasthya. We can see this told in fifty shlokas in the latter part. Nyasa is done in our country before the chanting of Sahasranama. It has 28 parts. They go by names like Shoda nyasa. I am not going to elaborate on that here because it will be covered later in Sahasranama. There are three main things to be done. Nyasa is done to awaken the consciousness of the devata whom we worship and the Devatas presiding on different parts of our body by touching them with our hands and visualizing the devata sankalpas are present there. Rishi nyasa, chandass nyasa, devata nyasa are the three components. Before the chanting of Sahasranama, touching with hands the specific parts and visualizing the presence of the devatas is the simple meaning of nyasa. Sages of Lalita Sahasranama are Vagdevatas like Vashini. Anushtup is the chandas (metre of chanting the hymns and mantras). Anushtup is a circle. The entire Lalita Sahasranama is done in Anushtup. Anushtup Chandass has four parts. Each parts contains eight letters. A part contains eight letters. Two parts constitute ardha shloka. Two ardha shlokas constitute a stotra in Anushtup. This is the order. We touch our head, chant Sanskrit shloka and with that sankalpa, we chant the whole stotra. Touching our heart, we visualize Lalitha Maha Tripura Sundari as the devatas who is residing in our hearts. Rishis or sages are Vagdevatas like Vaishini. Chandass is visualized by keeping our hand before our mouth. We remember Lalita Parameshwari by touching our heart. Nyasa is the simplest action containing Rishi, Chandass and Devata

We discussed the parts Rishi Nyasa, Chandass Nyasa and Devata Nyasa. Sages are Vagdevatas like Vashini, Anushtup is the chandass. Lalitha Parameshwari is the devata. This is followed by the dhyana (mediation) of Devi. By seeing the Whole form of Devi in our heart some people chant only one shloka. This is very famous. Some chant two, three or four shlokas. Different forms of Devi are described in them. Devi can be meditated upon in the form that is one’s favourite.

sindūrāruṇa vigrahām trinayanām
māṇikya mauli sphurat tārānāyaka śekharām
smita mukhīm āpīna vakṣoruhām
pāṇibhyām alipūrṇa ratna caṣakam
raktotpalam bibhratīm saumyām
ratna ghaṭastha rakta caraṇām
dhyāyet parām ambikām
O Mother Ambika, I meditate on Your resplendent red form with three sacred eyes, wearing a sparkling crown jewel and the crescent moon and displaying a sweet smile, with Your large breasts brimming with motherly love holding in one hand jewel-studded vessel filled with honey and encircled by bees and lotus flowers on the other with Your red lotus feet resting on a golden jar filled with jewels!

We should know an approximate meaning of this shloka. Devi is an image in red. We are not able to see Paramatma with our senses. We cannot see Devi with our eye, hear with ear. Devi is not seen with senses. She is an experience beyond senses. At the same time Devi assumes a form to bless us. She makes us understand little details of Paramatma. Hence she is beyond the reach of senses. We are able to grasp her in special circumstances. We are able to know certain aspects about Paramatman. The idol is its symbol. The Idol is the symbol of Paramatma. Even though she is the all-pervading consciousness, she assumes a form to bless her devotees, hence Paramatman has no colour. Paramatma is the embodiment of purity and truth. She assumed a red form out of her compassion for her devotees. She has three divine eyes. She is wearing a crown of precious gems. She is wearing the crescent moon as an ornament. We address Devi as Mother of many millions of universes. We do not have to fear for that reason. We need not fear of inability to go near Devi because of her greatness. We can see in Amma’s dhyana shloka also “Mandasmita shree mukheem”. She welcomes us with a smiling face. She has a big chest. Taking pride in the fact that I am the Mother of all. Devi gave birth to everyone from Brahma to the tiniest of atoms. Devi is resplendent with pride, taking pride in being the mother of all. She holds a pot of gems filled with honey. Honey is the symbol of immortality. She is holding a pot of Honey as a hint that those going to her will attain immortality. She is holding red lotus flower in her hand. She is not ferocious. A gentle form is described here, her feet are placed on a pot of precious gems. Once somebody asked Kanchi Paramacharya a doubt. Why has she placed her feet on a pot? Isn’t it difficult? We feel comfortable if we place our feet on a level surface. Devi’s red feet are beautiful. When he was asked this, he did not say anything then. Later, he got into palanquin and travelled. A lady brought him a pillow made of velvet which, he kept it under his feet. Since he walked a lot, he felt good when he kept his feet on that piece of cloth. He called the person who posed a doubt and told him, “You can meditate upon Devi’s feet as ratna paṭastha rakta caraṇām instead of ratna ghaṭastha rakta caraṇām meaning, on a soft red material instead of a pot. It will be good for the soft feet of Devi”. Devi has placed her soft feet on a pot filled with precious gems and wealth. Ambika means mother. Devi is the Supreme Mother. She is mother of all. May we meditate upon that Devi who is the Supreme Mother, thus commands this dhyana shloka.

We have seen the general meaning of the meditation verse “sindūrāruṇa vigrahām trinayanām māṇikya mauli sphurat tārānāyaka śekharām…”” Of the Lalitha Sahasranama. We saw a description of the Devi who has two arms.

The next Dhyana sloka is

aruṇām karuṇā taraṅgitākṣīm dhṛta pāśāṅkuśa puṣpa bāṇa cāpām
aṇimādibhir āvṛtām mayūkhai raham ityeva vibhāvaye maheśīm

The description here is of Devi who has four arms. We can meditate upon Devi in whichever manner our imagination unfolds before us. If we are able to dissolve our mind into one of her glorious forms, and devote ourselves to the worship of Devi in that particular form, the purpose of our life will be fulfilled. In this sloka, Devi has a glorious red form (aruṇām). Her enchanting eyes are constantly moving with compassion. (karuṇā taraṅgitākṣīm)

bhruvau bhugne kiñcid
bhuvana bhayabhaṅga vyasanini
Saundarya Lahari 46

Devi’s eye brows are slightly bent always. Devi is never able to straighten her brows. The reason is this. All the beings in this universe are her children. All her children bear the burden of one or more of the three forms of sorrow called the Thapa Trayas. She is always concerned about her children, how to solve their problems, cure their illness and grant them peace of mind. Devi is constantly thinking of the welfare of her children, longing to be of service to them and hence her eyebrows are always furrowed. Waves of compassion are continuously flowing from her eyes. Compassion overflows from every glance of Devi. She blesses her children with her compassionate glance. In her four arms she holds the noose and the goad, the bow and the arrows of flowers. Like Manmatha, the god of love, Devi holds a bow of sugarcane with arrows of flowers. She is surrounded by Anima and the other devatas. All of us take pride in the fact that we are a physical body. But the goddess has no consciousness of her body. She takes pride in the fact that she has manifested as the entire universe. I meditate upon the resplendent form of Devi as the Parahanthaa Swaroopini, who is manifested as the cosmos. This is the meaning of the verse, “aruṇām karuṇā taraṅgitākṣīm …….. vibhāvaye maheśīm”.
21:09
We are going to hear the explanation of the third Meditation Verse.
dhyāyet padmāsanasthām vikasita vadanām padma patrāyatākṣīm
hemābhām pītavastrām kara kalita lasad hema padmām varāṅgīm
sarvālaṅkāra yuktām satatam abhayadām bhaktanamrām bhavānīm
śrī vidyām śānta mūrtim sakala sura nutāmsarva sampat pradātrīm
The scriptures command us, ‘Meditate upon Devi!’ Devi is seated on a lotus flower. Her eyes are wide open and beaming with bliss. Her face exudes and reflects the peace and pure bliss that Devi is established in. Her large and beautiful eyes resemble the lotus petals. Her wide open eyes beaming with happiness are large, long and incomparably beautiful. Devi, golden in colour, is dressed in yellow garments. Her lovely body is adorned with ornaments. Her beauty is peerless and we are unable to identify which is the most beautiful part of her captivating physical form. She shines with all the noble physical features. Even without any ornaments, the beauty of Devi is unmatched. In our land, Mahatmas like Ramana Maharshi used to wear only a loin cloth, kaupinam. His disciples have written that they could notice nothing about him but his radiant face. He did not even wear a Rudraksha mala, a garland or Rudraksha beads. The loveliness of their limbs that glow with the radiance of oneness with the Universal Divinity and energy cannot be described by the limited logic of the brain. The Devi that we meditate upon in this verse is wearing ornaments. The beauty of the ornaments have been embellished by the radiance of Devi. The ornaments are made attractive by the splendor of the beauty of Devi. There is an example given by Amma. There is no need to decorate a gold pot with red mark or tilak. The golden pot is beautiful in itself. It is for the happiness of her devotees that Devi glows resplendent with jewelry and fine clothing. She grants refuge to each devotee who seeks her protection. She fulfils their desires.

The phrase “Bhaktanamram” can be defined in two ways. Devotees bow down before her. Every single minute of their lives they seek refuge in the shelter of her lotus feet. Another meaning is that Devi bows down to her devotees. She sees each one of her devotees as embodiments of her own pure self and bows down before them. It is said that Devi has a slight bend from bowing constantly. She is enamored of her devotees. She does not consider herself to be the empress of this universe. She slew Bhandasura after a long, fierce and terrible fight. Everybody praised Devi. But it is said that Devi walked away with bowed head, saying in all humility ‘I have done nothing’. So the term Bhaktanamram has two meanings. The one whom the devotees bow down to, and the one who bows down to her devotees. ‘Bhavani’ – Devi who is the wife of Bhavan. ‘Sri Vidya’- Devi who is the Sri Vidya. Devi who is the ‘Shanthamoorty’–the embodiment of peace. “Sarva Suranutham” – Devi who is worshipped by all the Devas. ‘Sarva Sampath Prathathrim’ – Devi who bestows all the riches on those who bow down before her. The Scriptures command us to meditate upon such a beautiful form of Devi. We can also say ‘Dhayami’. We can also chant it as ‘Dhyayeth’.
